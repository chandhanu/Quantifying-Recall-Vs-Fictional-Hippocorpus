It uses a magnetic field and radio waves to make images. I have not heard the results yet.  I am not too worried because my symptoms have not been getting worse.  I trust my doctors and MRIs.

Apparently they could not fathom that I did not baptize my child under their Catholic customs, which is something I was always vehement about not believing, but they did not want to see it nor care until now when it was my daughter's turn to be baptized, they felt it was my duty as a born Catholic.

My children are way too young to get married and no one in my family is arguing like that.,"Just four months ago, my daughter married her long time boyfriend.  I always knew they would get married but it was still kinda surprising and emotional when they announced it.  The wedding itself was just a small family affair that happened at the court house with a celebration afterwards.  She wanted it like that and I was fine with it too.  It was less planning and fanfare which is more her style.  One of the best things about this wedding is that my son came and he and my daughter got to be reunited with each other.  They've been arguing and hostile with each other for the past five years so this was kinda a big deal.  I was so glad to see them finally reconcile with each other because it's been a huge strain for me having them fighting with each other.  It makes it hard because neither will come to family get togethers like Christmas if they know the other is there and this makes me so sad.  I want the whole family together and it's just not the same if one is not there.  So this was a big deal to me and made the wedding all the more meaningful.  I didn't know that my son was going to come and actually I expected him not to, so I was really surprised when he showed up.  I saw him talking to my daughter later that night at our house and I expected it to get heated but to my surprise they were laughing and smiling.  Turns out from what he told me later they both apologized to each other and decided life was too short to continue arguing.  I am so glad and warmed in my heart that they have made up with each other.  It was tearing my heart apart that they had tension with each other and now I feel so much better.  I just hope they can continue getting along and don't fall back into that horrible state again.  Now I can't wait to become a grandmother.",1.0,"My daughter got married to her boyfriend.

We had been talking about it for a while, and the timing finally seemed right.

So, in April of this year I, found a doctor who actually does ankle REPLACEMENT surgery. Now, prior to about 5 years ago, this was unheard of and the only thing available was a fusion of the ankle bone, which is probably why I did not have anything done earlier. The surgery is so new, that there are no predictions as to how long the joint will last, because there is no long term data yet. But, in April I took the plunge and had my right ankle replaced. Although the recovery is said to last up to a year (I'm 4 months in), I am walking without pain for the first time in years.

After the long thirty hours it took to get to my destination I get to customs and when I show them my passport I was told to sit down where nobody tells me a thing for an entire hour. At this point im terrified since this is my first time traveling internationally by myself and there are a bunch of people with automatic rifles who told me to sit down. The entire hour im picturing how im going to spend the rest of my life in a Vietnamese prison but eventually I find out that the consulate in San Francisco screwed something up and I was free to enter the country. So I walk down grab my bags and exchange some money for the taxi ride. For months I had been researching Vietnam and all the scams that happen so I knew one of the big ones was that you always take a taxi with a meter. As I walk out of the airport some guy comes up to me and asks if I need a taxi. I say yes and we walk to his car. He tells me $40 and I say meter but he says he doesnt have one. We go back and fourth for a while and eventually I accept since that price sounds reasonable, its 3 AM and I havent slept in over a day. So we drive to my hotel and everything is fine. Eventually I come to find pretty much every taxi is about one dollar anywhere in the city. Months of panning to not get ripped off gone out the window 30 seconds into my trip.

I tell this guy no 20 times but he continues to walk with me. Then he starts showing me pictures of him with only white people and their handwritten notes that talk about how amazing he is. Obviously a scam as I continue to walk to the market but he wont leave. During the walk some little five year old girl walk up to me and starts holding my hand which scares me more than anything. I try to shake my hand to get her to let go but she refuses. Eventually the man gets her to let go so at least now im happy he is there. I finally make it to the market so the man leaves.

Where I live in particular is hilly and did I mention has many trees? I eventually found myself in new territory with my dogs, and confused about which direction home was in. This confusion kept hitting me for about an hour and a half, walking back and forth continuously coming back to an area. The final time I came back to this area in the woods, I noticed something unusual, numerous letter 'P's or '9's hanging from small tree branches, made of felt material. It was very odd to see, as there were at least a dozen or more hanging in this small area off these one or two trees and their numerous small branches. I immediately took that as a sign from where I was standing in relation to these letters/numbers, I had to go in the westerly direction.

Prior months to this date all 3 of my dogs were fine and healthy, running and playing like any normal dogs would and should. One day in May my Black Lab started to limp slightly but nothing to serious and worrisome, considering my 3 dogs played rough and wild we thought it was just a minor injury. A week went by and the limp was getting noticeably worse. My mom and i became concerned and soon after called and schedule a Vet appointment for the following week. The day finally came to take my dog, to the vet, thinking it was a minor issue my vet gave her a quick look and basically said she was fine and just hurt her back jumping. At that point i was not to concerned thinking he knew exactly what he was talking about. Another week went by and the limp got even worse. Again we took her back to the Vet, this time he had done an X-ray. Days later the results of the X-ray came back and he said she had a slight disc slip in her back, that has been there a while but nothing that should be causing the limp, he gave her medication for inflammation and sent us on our way. A few days went by and at this point nothing he gave her was helping and no answers that we were looking for came about. Finally we decided to take her to a specialist Vet who does all kind of blood testing and jelly scans and better testing. My family and I walked in that day to the specialist thinking that we were going to pay for our dog to get any surgery she needed to help her limp. After hours of waiting for her blood test results and scan results we finally got our answer, our dog had cancer. We were crush, our lives were shattered the moment we heard she had spleen cancer. For a single moment we were excited to find out that surgery could be done for 10 thousand dollars that we were 100000% willing to pay, but only if the cancer has not spread into her lymph nodes. Upon a few further tests the Vets found that it had spread all through out her body and lymph nodes. That night and the next day we said our goodbyes at that point she was no longer able to walk.

Remembering back to the day of this life changing event, I still remember and feel the sensations of that moment as it happened on that day. Memory has a way of staying vivid when something very powerful sets motion within your senses. Moments like this are never forgotten, as if the event took place recently, even though many years,perhaps decades have faded away. Time may fade away, but when you are responsible for changing the life of someone else for the better. Unlike time, this type of significance never fades away. To this day, I think about that moment when I helped that elderly man in the store, and what may have happened to him had I not been there, as if I was sent there by forces beyond my control to earn my role within humanity. I realize every day, that my life really did change from that moment, this which reflects the overall impact of my existence, and the value of it's meaning. I just hope that someday, when I am in a time of need, that some guardian angel may rescue me from whatever negative aspects which may abound me. If I had not been there in that store on that day, at that time, would this event be someone else's memory to reflect upon, or perhaps the opposite may hold true. These memories could have been dark and painful. For had this man died as a result of nobody there to save his life, this would have been an everlasting tragic event for others close to him. Funerals are hard to forget as well. Unfortunately, that is not the type of memory I want to hold onto. So, in the long run, I feel justified with an enriched focus upon my life focus. I truly feel as though I have earned significant credit toward my worthiness as a human being on this plane of existence.",1.0,"I recently experienced a a life changing event which had a profound effect upon my sense of humanity.

I had placed her car seat inside my shopping basket and we were touring the health food section. Suddenly my phone rang and an unfamiliar voice said, “This is your father’s apartment manager. There’s been an emergency.” All I could think was that my dad had probably been taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital or something. So I asked the woman, “Are they taking him to the hospital by ambulance? What hospital are they taking him to?” Then the woman replied, “No, he’s not going to the hospital. Your father has passed.

It was quite embarrassing and afterwards I felt like I should've known better. My baby sister was about seven months pregnant and had changed the name of her gestating child from the one she'd originally chosen. She and her boyfriend had at first settled on Liam Michael. Liam was a name she'd been set on since teenage years and Michael is our brothers middle name. Suddenly they'd changed the name to Tucker Finn. Those who heard the name including myself, my boyfriend and my brother all privately laughed. Everyone thought it wasn't a great name because it rhymes with many unpleasant words, such as sucker and another word starting with ""F"". All we could think is of how that poor child would get teased mercilessly by his peers. Al three of us became increasingly uncomfortable about how everyone in the family privately snickered but nobody, includng us had spoken up. It felt rude for everyone to be almost sharing a private joke at my sister's expense. We began to surmise that maybe it was her boyfriend who'd initiated the name change or that maybe they just had not thought further about the name. So of course, I was elected to gently inquire,being the closes to my sister.  I thought was the right thing to do and both my brother and boyfriend urged me to. I finally asked her gently as possible why they changed the name. I said ""Tucker is okay but Liam was great and you'd wanted it for so long"". Well, she explained that they'd decided Liam was overused. She stated that she found my inquiry rude. I apologized profusely and said I'd meant no harm, I just wanted to be sure it was what she wanted. She accepted but was obviously not cheerful. Later, feeling ashamed, I googled etiquiette on baby names and realized I should've kept my thoughts to myself. The next day I apologized again and she accepted again, but was quite annoyed because after our conversation her boyfriend told her he didnt like the name Tucker Finn. Suprisingly my boyfriend, brother and I had been right that one of the pair didn't like the name but it was not the one we'd expected.

I had been suffering from anxiety and depression for a really long time, and I had been suffering in silence. The first day of therapy I realized this was something that I had been needing for a long time. It wasn't until our third or fourth session that more memories started coming to the surface. These memories had been repressed for quite some time and I finally felt like I had somebody to talk to about them to. I didn't feel any judgement, there was no eye roll or glaring. There was no, ""that was a long time ago, get over it"". I was able to just speak the words as they came to me. I'll never forget that experience. Once I finally began to breathe deeply again she told me how proud she was that I was able to share all of those things with her. I really recommend therapy for anybody that has things on their mind that they feel they need to keep to themselves. The session is all about you and they won't make you feel like you are a burden for taking the time to speak to them. You don't have to worry about them discussing your personal matters with friends or family that could come back to bite you. Your information that you share is private and at the same time you're sharing it with an actual person. I remember feeling a massive amount of relief that I had discussed my life so thoroughly and was made to feel normal afterwards. Any other time I've touched on past issues with friends or family, I didn't feel relief, I felt annoying and like I was  dragging them down. The therapy session I had at week three or four is exactly what I had been needing for years. I will never forget that experience. I felt ten pounds lighter at least, and any time those memories surfaced and started to affect me I would just remember everything that was said to me during the session. That I don't need to hold onto those any longer. I can let them go. They no longer have the power to affect me.

I'd been working 50-55 hour weeks for the last three months. It was my fault too. I kept asking for more responsibility. I like the work; there just ended up being too much of it. I saw the Fourth of July coming up and had every intention of sleeping right through it. I was going to spend four days on my couch doing absolutely nothing. My buddy wouldn't let that happen. His family has a house on the beach and he insisted that I go with him. He knew how stressed I was. It was just what I needed. I essentially did what I planned to do at home. I slept a lot. I drank beer. I ate too much. But I did it surrounded by friends and on the beach. I returned to work recharged and ready for more.,2.0,I was overworked and it was showing.

She moved to New Jersey for college. It has been really weird here at home since then. I never realized how loud Jane was, it is unbearably quiet here now. Also, I have no one to talk to about anything. I always went to Jane's room for everything. We talked about boys, my grades, people who were mean to me, work, everything. And now I have no one to talk to, I can't really talk to my parents about these things. My parents are having a really hard time with the change, especially my mom. Mom cried for like 3 weeks after Jane left. Dad misses her too, but he doesn't really show his emotions like that. He has just been very quiet. We were able to all keep busy for the week after the move just cleaning up the mess from the move and doing chores, but now it is just dead and boring here. I am already trying to plan a trip to go see Jane. Unfortunately, New Jersey is pretty far from here so I would have to save up enough for a plane ticket. She will be home in 3 months, I can't wait. At least it gives us all something to look forward to.",1.0,My sister moved to another state far away.  I helped her move out and did some chores to help her when she was moving out.

Heart disease and heart issues run in the family, sadly it runs on both sides. I have always been very proactive with taking medicines and doing what the doctor had told me. I never really understood why they never told me that losing weight would help more, but I guess since my family is all overweight that they just assumed we didn't care about our bodies. When I had to switch doctors, one of the first things she asked was if I was ever looking to get off the medication. I told her that I would love to be off the medication, but no one had ever given me that option. She explained to me that my weight being what it was was a huge reason why I had high blood pressure. She went into all the science of it and even told me that if this conversation got to be too much, she would stop and not press the issue. I told her I was fine with the topic. She went on to tell me that losing weight could get me off all the medication and would decrease a lot of the issues that I had. I felt blindsided! Not for what she was saying, but because no doctor before her ever even asked me about this! Soon after that, I started counting calories and going for afternoon walks more. I watched what I ate and watched what I did. I lost some weight and really started to feel better about myself and my whole situation! Thankfully, 5 months ago I was taken off all medication to see how I feel about it. I felt so great! I loved not being tied down to having medication!",1.0,I finally got to stop taking the medication I had been taking for 5 years.

My husband sat on the one side because he was in the wedding ""unofficially"" and my daughter was one of the flower girls. During the ceremony, my son, who has autism, was being happy, making noise, being loud, but he also wanted to get down. My husband had him at the time. He happened to be sitting right behind the groom's father and step mother. My husband was trying to keep him entertained and get him to be quiet, but he's little so he didn't understand. The father and his wife kept giving side eye glances to my husband and son because they were annoyed. I tried to avoid the camera and go around to get my son because they were getting upset that they couldn't hear. I took my son to the back of the ceremony area where he couldn't annoy them anymore. He kept making noise and wanted to run around because he just didn't understand. I ended up missing a lot of the ceremony because I was busy entertaining my son and making sure he didn't run into the ceremony where they were filming. I guess I was surprised that someone could get that upset about a little boy making noise. He wasn't even crying, he was just having a good time. I was hurt that they could treat my son that way and that someone thought of him as an annoyance. I just felt bad for my child.",2.0,I attending my sister in law's wedding and my son couldn't sit still. The groom's father and stepmother were angry about it.,150.0,728.8025792279348
