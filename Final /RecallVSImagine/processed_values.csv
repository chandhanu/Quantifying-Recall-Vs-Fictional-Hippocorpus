I will never forget the look on my brother in law's face as he absorbed the feeling of being  father for the first time. His tears moved the room to tears.

Yikes. I still cringe to this day thinking about what happened three months ago. So Lynn, Eric and I were on the last leg of our road trip. We were heading to Acadia National Park. We were having a good time talking about what podcasts we were listening to lately. I mentioned that I started listening to a new true crime podcast. It piqued Eric's interest, so of course he turned around from the front passenger seat trying to get to his phone to pull up the podcast. Lynn was driving and was taken aback by a grown man trying to get to his bag like he was still a kid. It all happened so quickly. I tried to tell Eric that I would grab his phone, and to sit back down. But no he 's up already, and almost had it. That's when Lynn decided to pinch him on the rear end. All hell broke loose. Eric didn't expect it and rolled on his side. Too bad it was the driver's side. Lynn lost control of the car for a moment and we began to swerve towards the trees. Then she regained control. For that moment, all I could think about us crashing into the trees and my parents. Lynn pulled over to steady her nerves and to see if we were okay. We were fine physically but had the one of the biggest scares in our life. Moments later a police car pulled up to check if we were okay.

It was during the summer, and all of our bags were packed. My friends and I were ready to go to our trip to Acadia National Park.  We were extremely excited for this because we planned this all year long, and it was finally time to embark on our journey together. It was about a 5 hour drive, and it took a long time, but during this drive, it was extremely eventful. In fact, what happened that day could have been one of the scariest things that happened to us. While listening to some music, my friend was driving the car and singing along, and stopped paying full attention to the road. Suddenly, I could feel him drifting left to right and not have full control of the car. This scared me instantly, and I shut down the music being in the passenger seat, and told him to focus on the road. But there was a cop behind us looking at what we were doing, and he pulled us to the side just to ask to make sure if we were drunk or not. Just experiencing that part really scared us because we knew we all weren't drunk, but the feeling of being pulled aside is a scary moment. We continued with our journey, and the entire trip was great. However, just that moment was the one thing that resided within our minds throughout the entire trip.

My girlfriend, and I went to the Columbus Zoo about a month ago. It happened to be one of the hottest days recorded in July in the city! We had been planning this trip for weeks, so despite the weather, we decided to stick to our plans. Ashley and I have been working on spending more time together as we both work full-time jobs that prevent us from having date nights. More recently, I have been asked to work overtime on weekends, but this weekend I knew it would be more beneficial to spend time with her. We got to the zoo early before many of the large groups came and grabbed a snack from the snack bar so we could get a head start on seeing our favorite animals. Ashley really enjoyed seeing the elephants and giraffes, while I wanted to see the tigers and lions. The giraffes were running around playing with their young babies who looked as if they had just learned to walk. We were really lucky to see the penguins who were out swimming in the afternoon, but not for very long. It looked like they had gotten full from all of the fish they were being fed and went back into their private area to nap. I couldn't blame them for that! It felt like a much needed day together with my girlfriend. It meant a lot to me personally, as I have been stressed at work and Ashley finds a way to get me talk about some of the things I've been holding in. It was truly a wonderful experience. What was really neat is that the zoo offered free lemonade to their guests once the temperature got above 95 degrees. Ashley must have had a gallon of lemonade that day! I think Ashley had a great time also, as she talked about the animals on the entire drive back home.",1,"Me and my girlfriend went to the zoo on a hot day.

When we walked in there was the insect/reptile section of the zoo so we saw many exotic looking spiders, snakes, scorpions etc. I liked it but my girlfriend didn't like insects. Then we walked in the African animals section. We saw elephants mostly and we could hear monkeys and apes in the distance somewhere. So we keep walking and eventually we find the apes. We saw gorillas hanging out in the shade and in a different section we saw other chimps and monkeys. We walked past that and we saw giraffes. Watching the giraffes was a cool site because they got really close to us. Like one of them was looking at me and came in my direction and I thought it would actually do something to me. Then after we saw the lions and they were mostly hanging out in the shade to stay out of the heat. We continued to walk around and we saw a section with Australian animals. So we managed to see koalas in the tress and tasmanian devils. I think we also saw kangaroos but I can't remember. We spent a lot of time at the zoo maybe around 5-6 hours.

There were so many of them like spiders, scorpions, also bigger animals like cobras, rattlesnakes stuff like that. Then we saw the elephants. It was pretty interesting because they were in an area that looked like a jungle and off in the distance we heard gorillas grunting. So we walked around until we found the gorillas and around there we also saw other kinds of primates like chimpanzees. We walked around a bit more and we stumbled upon all the other African animals like tigers, lions, giraffes etc. It was actually pretty cool to see the giraffes because one of them got really close to me.

Every few years at least. I was in a small tourist town in Thailand right by Pattaya Beach. I was out fairly late one evening and decided to just roam around the city and take some pictures of the citizens there, the shops, nightclubs etc. I found myself in a rather secluded and dingy part of the city and wasn't sure exactly how to get back to my hotel. I was looking for one of the motorbike taxis but didn't see any. While I was looking around there was a group of Thais, probably in her early 20s and I could tell that they were part of a gang or something like that. I thought for sure I was going to get robbed or beat up or both. They were just across the small street giving me the eye and all of a sudden a taxi went by and I waved at him frantically. He saw me and drove over to where I was at and pick me up. I got back to my hotel safely but I was pretty shaken because I knew things were going to go badly if that small gang caught up with me. I was in that city for another two weeks and I still ventured out and about but I tried to be a lot more careful about what parts I ventured into. I really should have known better as I have been to quite a few other countries and have been in cities that were not very safe. Even though I'm somewhat used to being in these types of environments, they can still be very scary. Tourists have been known to disappear and never show up again.

It was a lovely wedding– very unlike any wedding I’ve yet been to, but a lot like the weddings in the movies (you know, like The Wedding Crashers… never understood why someone would *want* to go to a wedding they weren’t invited to).  The ceremony was short and simple, though there were a lot of attendants, complete with flower girl and ring-bearer.  The bride had both her father and step-father give her away, one on each arm.  The Lutheran minister was kind of a jolly middle-aged woman.  The gentlemen were almost all in army dress uniforms.  From my cousin’s face, you could not tell he was hit by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan just a few months ago.  He’s still not walking correctly and never may, but the damage seems to mainly be concentrated in one leg. The wedding was in a part of the country where folks are not as stiff as Midwesterners or as unstructured as Northern Californians.  I’ve been to Midwestern wedding receptions that tried to be like this reception, but the soul wasn’t there so they always ended up being kind of lame with folks congregated in the parking lot to talk away from the DJ.  People at this wedding line-danced (and not just to country music) and they enjoyed it.  My usually introverted uncle is apparently a dancing fiend and led the bride in some traditional dances.  This essay is plagiarized.  The food was great and full of local specialties (including something we heard about on the Splendid table from their road trip foodies).  And, important in my book for any wedding, they served appetizers between the wedding and reception. You may recall that the groom’s parents had said they refused to attend because he was not getting married by a priest.  Not only did they not show up, despite his being hit by a roadside bomb in service to our country, they did not allow any siblings to come.  The daughter whose college my parents and aunts are paying was threatened with being disowned when her mother found out she was planning to attend.  So she didn’t go.

I will forever remember it as something sticking and in all honesty, the day I became an adult. Not that I wasn't one already. On that day, I remember I did everything as I would each day prior to work. I ate breakfast, drank my regular cup of coffee with cinnamon sprinkled on top, etc. However, on my way home, I began thinking about an argument I had with my mom a few days prior. I was thinking about how it made me feel and the events that led up to the event. As I parked, I saw that no one was home except my mom. I went ahead and entered my house, and went to grab a snack. As I closed the refrigerator, I saw my mom standing in the hallway. I approached her to speak about the events from the other day. We went back and forth in a very emotional conversation. This was probably one of the most intense conversation I have ever had with my mom. She told me so many things that it made me think twice about how I was behaving towards her. It was the day that I found out my mom did not know how to swim. I HAD NO IDEA. I was honestly so shocked and surprised that I had seen my mom in pools before, but never knew she couldn't swim. How can I not know something so important about my mom?Which made me realize that I only have one mother. I should be paying more attention to her. I should be bonding with her more. Because one day, she will not be there. After the compelling conversation, we then proceeded to plan a mother/daughter day. We planned to eat tacos that weekend and watch a movie together, which we did. It was honestly of the best weekends ever.

Feeling we had nothing to hide, we simply acquiesced. He began just rummaging through the glovebox, and we knew we were fine. Nothing to find, here.

I thought, no problem, and told him it would be ok since I was off that day. I told him just to gas up and get it back safely after his shift. Little did I know that he had other plans in store that involved the law and I was being taken for a ride so to speak. This is the story of how my good friend got arrested and it led to the end of our friendship. After my friend took the car, I got a call from the police about an hour later saying that he was now in prison and I had the option of bailing him out. I did end up bailing him out, but thought - what in the world is going on? It turns out he had been tipped off that something was going on at his work and so when he took my car - thinking they would not recognize him in it - he was still arrested at his job place (during his shift) for embezzlement. His plan had not worked and in the process, I also could not pick up my car right away. Turns out it had to be impounded and I had to pay an additional 80. 00 dollars to get it out of the lot since I was not present at the time of this activity. This whole situation affected our relationship in a number of ways. We are still friends and ok generally, but not as close now. It broke my trust with my friend and made me look around at all things in my life. And secondly, it showed me that people you know, even, will do anything when they are desperate. He had been having money trouble and thought he could get away with this. It turns out cameras at his job place knew different and that is how he was eventually caught.

He had smashed the top of his foot and a few of the bones was shattered. We had to explain to the nurses and doctors that the teacher told us that him and a few other boys were playing with desks and one fell on his foot. We got the surgery scheduled and our son was a trooper and didn't really seem phased by it. More than we can say about ourselves because we were scared out of our minds about this!

It was not something that needed urgent attention, but the doctors told us that he would probably need to have it surgically removed at some time in his life. Sometimes extra digits are just flesh, but my son's was well-developed with bone, blood vessels, and tendons. As a baby, the extra toe did not hinder his development at all. He started walking around 12 months old, the typical age. However, shoes were hard to find to accommodate his much wider than average foot. We spoke with a specialist when he was two years old, but she wanted to wait at least a year for the surgery because the risks from anesthesia lessen in slightly older children. We returned to the specialist just after he turned four. Given that the surgery wasn't an emergency, we had to wait a few months for an appointment time to be available. On the day of the surgery my son was calm and happy. Being so young, he wasn't really aware what was about to happen. The surgery was also taking place in a children's hospital, so they had a lot of toys and other accommodations to make him feel comfortable. The surgery went quickly and smoothly, but waking up was difficult for my son. He was in a lot of pain and required three shots of morphine into his IV before he felt better. However, after that initial discomfort, the rest of the recovery went really well. He never needed pain medicine and was up waking around with his cast by that evening. After two weeks, he was able to have his cast removed. His foot was tender and sensitive without the support and protection of the cast, but after about three days he was able to walk normally again. Now the only thing that remains from the surgery is a light scar on the side of his foot.",1,My four year old son needed foot surgery.

He was born with a condition called polydactylism, which means having extra fingers or toes. In my son's case, he was born with an extra pinky toe on his left foot. As a baby it was easier to manage, since babies obviously don't need shoes, but now as a preschooler his extra little toe would often hurt him while wearing tennis shoes. My husband and I always knew that he would need this surgery, but we were still worried when the day actually arrived. Neither he nor I, nor our older son, had ever needed surgery before. This was uncharted waters for us. When we arrived at the hospital Thursday morning, the nurses took his vitals to make sure he was healthy enough for surgery that day. Other than that, a lot of the time was just spent waiting. It made my husband and I feel sad because our son was hungry but he was not allowed to eat prior to the surgery. Thankfully the hospital did have a good amount of toys that helped keep him distracted. Finally around 12:30 in the afternoon he was taken back for his surgery. My husband and I were not allowed to go back with him, but the nurses and doctors made it fun for him by taking him back in a big push car. Once they got to the room, they put a small mask on his face with the strawberry scented gas he had picked out earlier. After he was asleep with the gas, they put the needle in his hand for the other anesthesia. Surgery only lasted about one hour. The nurse came to get my husband and I to take us to where our son was recovering. He's normally a really happy little guy, but unfortunately he was in a lot of pain and very confused coming out of his surgery. He ended up needing three shots of morphine in his IV to manage the discomfort. Thankfully it seemed to work quickly and soon we were on our way home. He seems to be recovering well and we're thankful his surgery was an over-all uneventful, yet memorable, experience.",1,My four year old son needed foot surgery.

When we were kids we fought a lot. She liked chocolate I liked strawberry, ice cream. I liked rock music, she liked jazz. We would argue a lot. We had different friend groups. That was that. This was about 10 years ago. We were both musicians growing up. I played rock music in a band and she was always practicing classical violin. We never paid much attention to each other due to this difference in stylistic taste. When she went to music school 2 months ago I knew she would broaden her musical tastes, and I supported her work. I was extremely surprised last week at her concert. Her jazz band played music that was very angular and dynamic the way that certain rock music is. I asked her about this. She said that she ended up with some members in her band that had rock music tastes like me. She was able to see that as something they had in common to make music about. I never expected her to make any music like that.",3,My sister and  were not the most cooperative siblings as we were growing up.

I would theorize it could have been mostly due to competition for the affection of our parents. I was the second child...she was the first. She was the one with stellar grades all throughout her education, from kindergarten all the way through her prestigious university years. She is now a professional musician in an orchestra as well as a music teacher. Growing up I tended to be a rather mediocre student. I am confident that I am intelligent, I just never have had the drive to excel. Perhaps because I knew devoting a great deal of energy to ""competing"" with my sister would not only be futile, but absolutely exhausting. I have always been one to get lost in my thoughts and I prefer to be in nature to feel truly alive. That is why it was so memorable that a few months ago my mother told me that recently my sister told her that she only knows particular symphonies because she would hear me playing them in my room, next door to hers. I did not even know she was listening to the music I was playing, I always pictured her diligently reading and/or practicing the various instruments with which she is now proficient. After hearing that from my mother I actually felt a rush of pride. Not only was I absorbing and getting lost in the extraordinary music, but I was also influencing my orchestral musician sister. To add to that, the other day, she called me up about a certain composer because, as she put it, I am a ""musicologist of sorts."" (In  addition to listening to music, I would study biographical information about the various composers to whom I listened. Back in my childhood days, I never would have dreamed that I would be having an unintended influence on my rather brilliant sister. It just goes to show that perceptions of the moment are not always accurate...it helps to get perspective outside of your own head.",1,My sister and  were not the most cooperative siblings as we were growing up.

Two baby girls! After a few worrisome doctor visits, we found out one baby was absorbed by the other. While we were very saddened by the loss of one baby, we were ecstatic about the healthy baby girl my wife was carrying. While my wife was nesting in preparation for parenthood, I was reading every baby book I could find! By the time the baby, Ella, was born, we felt we were prepared but we couldn't have been more wrong. No amount of reading can prepare you for the immediate and immense love you feel when you first hold your child. I knew from the moment I looked at those warm brown eyes that I would lay down my life for this child. There is no greater joy than seeing something so perfect and knowing that you are the reason it exists. The first month was the hardest. Adjusting to a new baby in the house, and her sleep/wake schedule while maintaining our own routines was very taxing on our relationship. I'll admit, I could have tried harder. Unfortunately, that's the thing about hindsight, only it is 20/20.

The thing of it is,  I was not on my way downstairs.  I was going from my bathroom to my upstairs sitting room, which is right next to the stairs.  I normally have no problem with this but i neglected  to turn on the lights in the hallway and I was unable to see where I was going.  I have glaucoma, so it is very hard for me to see in low light conditions.  I was totally unaware of the peril, as I was making my way out of the bathroom and my first sensation as I felt myself falling was surprise.  I did not feel shock or horror; it was just a feeling of knowing what was happening and being surprised that it was happening.  I remember hitting the steps on my right side, my full weight on my right shoulder and I believed I heard a voice telling me exactly what was happening.  It was like my brain was giving me an instant damage report.  Maybe it was real or maybe it was just the result of me hitting my head.  But, tht is the one thing I most remember about the incident.  I ended up twisted in an odd position on the first landing of the steps and my right foot had broken through one of the banister railings.  I layed there for a few moments, not yet feeling the pain, but knowing that I was hurt badly.  My mother came from out of her room to attend to me, trying to help me up at first, but when I screamed in pain after she pulled my arm, I just told her to call for help.  The EMTs arrived quickly  and I think I  must have ruined their night.  They questioned me like I meant to fall down the stairs and then didn't bother to brink a stretcher to move me to the ambulance.  They grabbed my by my arms and pulled me down the stairs , out of the house and into the ambulance like I was a soldier being evacuated from a battlefield.  I was in pain and pissed.",2,"I fell down the stairs in my home and suffered a broken collarbone, several broken ribs and a subdural hematoma.

I  I splashed water on my face and exited the bathroom, intending to go to my upstairs sitting room to see if the outside porch door was closed.  I had neglected to turn any lights, so the hallway was dark.  I took a path that I thought would lead to my sitting room, but,  I found myself falling through space.  I has accidentally gone toward the stairs and tumbled over.  I remember hitting the first flight on my right side, and heard a strange voice, describing, to me, exactly what was happening.    I knew I was hurt, badly, and I lay there for a few seconds, not yet in intense pain, but just trying to come to terms with what had just happened.  Luckily, my brother was staying with me and he came quickly and helped me get my self into a proper position.  The pain had set in and I was sure I had hurt myself pretty badly.  My brother, called 911 and the ambulance arrived very quickly.  The two EMT's assessed the situation, carefully, and for some reason decided to grab me by my arms and legs and carry me out of the house.  I  don't know why they did not get a stretcher, maybe they just wanted to cause more pain, which they did.  Once I was in the ambulance, they made me as comfortable as possible, but I realized that I could not really answer their questions, properly, because I was slurring my speech, badly.  They surmised that I had a a brain injury.  Once at the hospital,  I was asked many questions , but again, I could not answer, properly, due to my slurred speech.  They kept asking me to smile.  I later found out that is how to check to see if you have had a stroke.  I was  X-ray'd  and I received a MRI.  They found that I had a broken right collarbone and several broken ribs on both sides.  Also, I suffered a subdural hemotoma that caused bleeding on my brain.  They were obviously more worried about my brain injury.  I received a half dozen MRI's of my head.  As far as the broken bones, they just gave me a splint and told me that the collarbone and ribs would heal over time.  For the next ten days, my stay at the hospital consisted of doctors asking me to smile and to squeeze their fingers.  My slurred speech disappeared but I did notice a lingering numbness in my left hand, that has since disappeared and a numbness on the left side of my face, that has not.",1,"I fell down the stairs in my home and suffered a broken collarbone, several broken ribs and a subdural hematoma.

I really felt so hopeless when I was trying to talk with that Spanish speaking family to ensure everyone was ok and reassure them that help was on the way.  Of course I would be the first person on the scene and probably the one person in the area that did not know any Spanish!  I was relieved that the police and fire department showed up so quick.  I was so desperate for help and unable to effectively communicate with the family inside the car still that I literally felt sick.  I am so glad my friend told me about the duo lingo app shortly after the incident.  I downloaded the app almost immediately and was very surprised at how easy it was to start learning another language.  It did not take long before I had a basic understanding of the language.  Shortly after that I could follow along in a conversation and eventually I felt comfortable enough to start answering back in Spanish.  Although I hope to never find myself in that same situation again, at least I'll be prepared to help if it were to happen again.

So I searched the internet and other sources for the best learning apps and websites that I could find. My journey was a long a tedious one because some of the apps did not work or just did not help with the learning process as much. Then a friend told me about an app they were using which I might be interested in so I said okay what is the name of this new app and they said it's called duo lingo. So I downloaded it and finally I could speak spanish. It's no easy to learn spanish. It takes people years to learn. Also some people will never learn. Now is the time to learn as well.

Can't believe I haven't written on this yet, but let me say, what an adventure that was. We went down to the Keys to celebrate a long year of hard work and take some time off together and finally get some quality time. We went down under the water the first day, after a few alcoholic beverages (of course). The fish were awesome, the life was so colorful, but no color more intense than the sunburn I had when we finished up! Oh boy, did I make a mistake forgetting to put on sunscreen that day. I came out like an infrared camera on a hot cherry cobbler -- I am talking molten red. I remember saying, ""well, I'm gonna pay for this hard later on tonight!"" By the night time, I decided that if I drank more iced beverages it might keep my mind off of the sunburn, and, surprisingly, that worked well for a while. Sleeping was hell on Earth, though, as I had to lay on ice packs borrowed from the resort desk to even close my eyes. Luckily, the burns subsided rather quickly, and simply glowed an awful red for a few days before turning into a nice tan. Thankfully for me, I've always had a good ability to recover quickly from sunburns. Perhaps that's why I always forget about sunscreen? Hmm, I don't know, but it wasn't fun. After that fiasco, we got to do much more of what we had planned, enjoying snorkeling and swimming and honestly just a lot of relaxing.

It was when my boyfriend and I drove to Florida and went to the Florida Keys. We went snorkeling and this was the first time both of us had ever done this. It was memorable because of how amazing the experience was being somewhere completely new doing an activity and viewing things in a new way that we hadn't experienced before. And we got to do it together. It barely cost us any money and we got to have a great experience. The most surprising part of the whole ordeal was that I wasn't scared to go out deep into the ocean. I felt healthy and good about myself and the fact that I accomplished something that for myself was a big feat even if other people might not see it as a big deal. I had been very nervous to do this. We viewed sea creatures such as a few fish, a giant crab, and other smaller little crabs. There wasn't very many fish which I was surprised about but the experience was still interesting. I saw the way the sea worked and all of its components that make it the ecosystem it is today. I also realized how hot the sun is down there because we both got very burnt on our backs from them being exposed to the sun for a few hours. The time went by faster than I can ever remember and it was my most memorable experience this year. We want to go back but have no idea when.

So my friends birthdays was definitely a highlight of the last month, I still have some good memories about it and I smile every time I do. This even showed me different sides of of and what I could be and in this sense it is significant and I would even say life changing.  Some of the other things that I remember is playing darts with people I never met before, we had fun and I felt connected just playing this simple game. I also remember meeting a cute girl, she a blond hair and her name was Anabel, I felt like I known her for ages for some reason, maybe it was the music that made me feel nostalgic but probably it was just a dejavu. The birthdays itself lasted for two days, since it stated on the weekend and my friend could afford an even longer holiday. There were a lot of fun thing to do and the food was amazing, my favorite dish was pizza of course, it was a real Italian pizza from some high end catering service. Also the fresh sashimi was great and tasty. The music was great and the DJ did a great job adjusting to our mood and taking guest requests into consideration. So this birthday was more of a concert than a typical home birthday I am used to and expected to experience.  There were some people whom I've know since I was a kid and it was a very pleasant meeting since we haven't seen each other for ages.  At midnight there was a fireworks show and not like a small fireworks that you can buy anywhere on Halloween but an actual commercial grade fireworks which were huge and loud like it was a major holiday or something, so I really enjoyed that part since you don't see that too often in a common weekend. Since it was a two day celebration and since my friend has a big house, most guests could just stay overnight in one of the bedrooms, it made us all feel even closer and the next morning I felt even more connected to the new people I have met the previous day as well as to my old childhood friends.  Overall it was one of the best birthday celebrations in my life and I really enjoyed it and will probably remember it for a long time if not till the rest of my life.  It was his 30th birthday and I guess that's why he decided to do on such a large scale and many of us felt grateful for that, especially since we knew what a good and kind person he was and this wasn't even necessary for us to start thinking of him even better.",1,I went to a friend's birthday party on my own where I would not know a large majority of the other guests.

He was inviting a lot of other friends, and he was making a sort of event about the whole thing, marking it as both his birthday as well as his funeral. There was going to nearly 50 people there, some I was already very friendly with and some new faces, as well as lots of food, lots of drinks, and lots of games. I was very much looking forward to the party but a little bit nervous about meeting so many new people at once, as I am somewhat shy. I went over in mind about maybe backing out, maybe only sticking with the few friends there I already knew very well, but eventually I settled on just sucking it up and going on my own. When I got there, I instantly felt somewhat out of place because I only knew a few faces, but that did not deter me from having my mind set on having a good time. I threw myself out there in some games, got talking to a lot of new people, and ended up making a lot of new friends throughout the night. As it went on, I felt less and less shy and nervous about trying to make a good impression. I began to be able to break out of my shell and act like myself, and I am so glad I did. The whole party was an absolute blast and I made a lot of friends, many of whom I will be contacting in the future with more plans to hang out. This party was a big step for me. It has been awhile since I have been able to put myself out there and try to meet new people. I was nervous about whether or not these new friends would be receptive to my personality or if I would come off as the weird awkward dude in the corner. My good friends who were there even commented on how they were impressed with how social I was being with total strangers. That might have been helped by the few beers I had, but that liquid courage got me past the first few hurdles I needed help with.

After a year of trying and tracking my cycles we decided to seek medical intervention. We did test after test only to be given an ""unexplained infertility"" diagnosis. We were both young and healthy and couldn't believe this was happening. We were told to keep trying for an additional six months, before our Dr was willing to discuss treatment options. During this six months, I got pregnant 4 times, yet each resulted in an early loss. Because we had finally managed to conceive our Dr held off on treatments. Over the course of the next 18 months I got pregnant two more times. One resulting in a 25 week loss, and the other resulting in a 9 month loss two days before my due date from a cord accident. At this point, we were beyond devastated and just done. We couldn't bear the heartache anymore, and we couldn't afford the astronomical fees associated with IVF.

With each loss I lost myself a little more, and felt defeated, almost like I had done something wrong somewhere in my life to deserve some of the worst pain a person could ever experience. Our last loss was a third trimester loss, two days before my due date. Everything looked great through the pregnancy and I thought ""this is it, finally! we made it to the end safely"", until those dreams were shattered just as quickly as they pregnancy progressed. We discovered at a routine non stress test that the baby had no heartbeat and had passed from a cord accident. Even though each loss prior to this had been difficult, this was the worst. My entire life went dark and I no longer cared about anything. I can truly say this was darkest moment in my life. After months of suffering, my husband took me on a vacation to help me renew my spirit and mood, and surprise, we ended up getting pregnant on this trip. I felt so detached during this pregnancy and considered terminating as I was so certain it was going to end badly again. It is my pleasure to say it did not.

I decided to go all out when I got up there, since there was plenty of things to do I took my time and truly explored the region of Toronto in general.  The falls were truly breathtaking, and the water was quite cold since it was still winter time when I went.  Once I had my fill of the Falls I also checked out the Chinese cuisines that Toronto had to offer, and I was not disappointed, the food was truly amazing.  The vegetables were fresh, and crisp, while the rice was truly perfect, not too hard, and not too soft, but a good balance of firmness.  I also decided to see the CN tower, and was truly mesmerized by the sheer size of that structure, especially since it was right there, in downtown Toronto.  The sunset was also breathtaking and beautiful, but I don't think that is a strong enough word for how magnificent the sunset truly was.  I loved the trip because I do love exploring and just getting out and doing something different, exploring places I've never been before, and seeing the sheer beauty and raw power of nature, like the Falls provide.  The Chinese food was quite exquisite, as was the CN tower.   I would definitely recommend a trip like this one to my friends because it was such a nice place to go and see.  I think seeing the Falls and the CN tower should be on anyone's bucket list because of just how surreal the tower was, and how serene the Falls were, with that power, and sound of all of the water rushing.  The drive was a little bit rough from Kentucky, since the traffic also isn't kind once I got to Cincinnati, and then from there it just seemed to pick up more when I got up to Toledo and into Detroit.  I think it took me about 14 hours to drive up, I didn't stay at a hotel or anything, although I did take some pit stops to get food, fuel, and other various supplies.  I think I liked seeing the CN tower most, just because of how staggering it looks, right there in downtown Toronto, and also it's proximity to the rest of the city made it a very convenient place to visit while being close to the hotel and restaurants.  The Falls were a little bit far from the city, but not bad.  In closing, I'd like to say that this trip opened my eyes to what North America has to offer in general, and also what our northern neighbors have to offer also in terms of natural and man-made beauty.",1,"We were on a road trip driving from Kentucky, all the way to the Niagara Falls and Toronto.

My wife and I are busy professionals, and we also have an 8 year old. Things have been going downhill, and luckily, we eventually recognized that if my wife and I did not take time to build connections in our relationship, things would just get worse. As a result, we decided to take a long road trip all the way to Canada (my home country). My wife and son like to travel to new places, and therefore, this seemed like the perfect choice. The trip didn't start off well, as my wife realized a day before the trip that her passport had expired. I was a little anxious about this, but we decided to go anyway. We'd figured she'd have alternative documentation to enter Canada, and at most we would be delayed at the border on our way back. We stopped by at Columbus for night before arriving at Niagara Falls on the US side the next day. We took a little time to experience that side of the Falls before reaching our hotel on the Canadian side. It was awesome. We had a bird-eyes view of the Falls, which were brightly and colorfully illuminated at night. The next day we spent all our time exploring as many activities as we could. We definitely enjoyed the up-close experience next to the Falls, and didn't mind getting soaking wet. The next day we drove to Toronto so that we could visit the CN tower, one of Canada's landmarks. There was a long line up, but the wait was well worth it. Our son definitely enjoyed watching the city from way high above. We ended our visit  with sampling of some of the finer chinese food, which of course we can't find in Kentucky. Driving back made me a little nervous because of my wife's expired passport. W ehanded it to the Border Patrol agent, who asked me a few questions, before stating that  my wife's passport was expired. We pleased ignorance and offered my wife's drivers license, which we knew was not considered an acceptable form of ID for re-entering.

The closest I can identify with it is just the element of visiting Florida. I went to Disney World when I was a kid, and I vividly remember how amazing the tropical atmosphere was.","All of my years in college have finally been paying off for me, and I feel like I am on course to have a fulfilling career. Throughout all of the hard work and effort, I knew that there would come a time when I would finally be able to have some sort of payoff and be able to enjoy the fruits of my labors, if indirectly. I have always enjoyed spring break and have had a great time, when I could actually take my mind of of coursework and appreciate it for what it was. However, nothing compares to the fantastic concert I attended two months ago, after classes had wrapped up. Me and several of my friends pooled our money together to make it to a music festival that was taking place on a Caribbean island, not far off the coast of Florida. It was simply an incredible time, one of the best memories of my entire life. The quality of the light when you are closer to the equator is just sublime, and the thing that sticks in my mind more than anything else is the sight of the sunrise and sunset during those few days we were there. It felt like stepping into a new world, and I had actually never been anywhere like that even on vacation with my family as a kid. The actual music festival was of course very special, but most of our time was spent on other things. We stayed at a rented place that we pooled our money together for, and it was not all that expensive since there were a few of us in each room. The fishing trip we went on on the second day of our visit was probably the most activity I got the entire time. I didn't feel like working up much of a sweat when I was already soaked in it just the moment I stepped out the front door of our accommodations. The climax of the music festival was something that made me feel like I had goosebumps. One of my favorite electronic musicians was performing and the view of the sunset over the beach as the music built up was just otherworldly. It was not something that I would soon forget, and I think that there will probably be few chances to ever have an experience like this again in the future. One thing I can say is that I met a couple who were very interesting, and we exchanged contact details. So there is a significant chance we may do something together in the future, which is exciting.

I enjoyed a lot of the rides and all of the shows. The food at Disney World is just okay for the price but we did have some good meals and some ice cream.

I almost didn't go because Disney World is crowded and it can be hard to hang out with a four year but I had not seen that part of the family in awhile, my schedule was clear, and it had been 12 years since I had been to Disney World. So I decided to go. My favorite days were when it was just my mother in law and I and we went to Harry Potter at Universal. The theme park was so well done and the rides were really fun and the butter beer was really good. The main big ride I ended up going by myself because my mother in law didn't want to go. It was kind of scary but it was really fun and so well done with 3D effects and lighting. It was too crowded to go wand shopping but that is okay because my husband got me a wand previously when he was in Orlando for a work trip. We also had fun with my niece, she liked anything to do with Frozen. We had lots of good food, rode on some fun rides. I liked eating at the dinosaur theme restaurant. It was basically Rainforest Cafe but with dinosaurs. The hotel we stayed in was Little Mermaid theme so that was really cute. But it was kind of noisy and the buses were far away for our hotel. Overall it was a really fun trip and I am glad I went, but I would not be going back any time soon.

They had me doing my original job, plus a second job, for the salary of just one job.  The second job represented the next step toward my career goals and a realization of a lot of the time and resources I've put toward advancing my career.  However, the salary was not commensurate with the amount of work I was doing, I was putting in nearly 90 hours a week, and the situation was incredibly stressful.  It started to take a toll on my physical and emotional health and strained my relationships with family, friends, and coworkers.  The dual-role situation was expected to last one year, at which point my second job would be split off into its own role, which I would fill.  However, an the organization faced some unexpected financial hardship, which meant they had to reduce positions, rather than create new one.  This meant they asked me to continue in the dual role for another year, promising to split the roles in another year's time, when finances were better.  After a long and careful consideration, I determined to decline and take a position with another organization which would be a lateral move.  I applied for and was offered the new job, which I accepted.  After already initiating the onboard process with the new organization, my old organization called and begged me to come back.  They offered a slightly different arrangement of my role.  However, it would still require significant time (and likely stress) for the same amount of pay and no guarantee of the company's future stability.  It put me back in the throes of decision making.  Ultimately, I turned them down again but I did have some feelings of melancholy.  Fortunately, the latest update of this story takes a turn for the happy.  I have been recruited by a third organization to fulfill a newly created role in my desired field.  I've had a hand in defining the role, bargaining for my pay, and shaping the next steps of my career.

I also have a master's degree in career and technical education administration.  I am passionate about both; however, my long-term goal is to hold a district-level or higher leadership position in career and technical education.  In the district I have worked for the last several years, I was given the opportunity to be both special education teacher and career and technical education coordinator.  I had to do both simultaneously and I was given about a $2000 increase in pay for the added responsibility.  I had this unique arrangement for one year.  It was the most stressful year of my life and I routinely worked over 80 hours a week.  Toward the end of the year, I knew I was not going to be able to continue in this arrangement.  However, the district was putting forth a referendum to the community and one outcome of a passed referendum would be enough funding to split the career and technical education job off and make it standalone.  Unfortunately, the referendum failed and there was no money to pay for the jobs to be separate.  This meant I had to make a very difficult, tough decision to give up on career and technical education administration for the time being and take a job as a special education teacher in a neighboring district.  This was one of the hardest choices I have had to make; but, for the first time ever, I put myself and family ahead of my career and made the switch.  Then, a few weeks ago, the assistant superintendent of my former district called me and said they had found a way to offer me the career and technical education administration position without special education responsibilities, which is what I had originally been looking for.  However, I would have to also be the district's data and assessment coordinator and my salary would still be the same.  The chance to continue down the path of my career aspirations was so incredibly tantalizing.  On the other hand, the school year is about to start and I really like my new district a lot, the community is supportive, benefits are excellent, and I feel good about my future there.  The difficulty of the decision felt suffocating.  I actually threw up I was so anxious about it.  But, in the end, I decided to stick with my choice to take care of myself and told my old district that I could not come back.  I have thought about it a lot the last few weeks, and I am still glad I made that decision.

I've had some great neighbors there for the past 7 months, but they told me when I met them that that was only going to be a temporary place for them.  They were new to the area and just needed a place to live until they could find a home to buy.  They spent a long time looking for a place to call their own and eventually found it in a nearby town.

Of course I set everything aside to take the call, try to make a good impression, all that. It was crazy though, we were just chatting about how diligent I was when out of the blue he offers me a supervisor position in the department. I didn't even know we had an open spot! I jumped at the offer, naturally, and he said he'd have his secretary bring the papers over shortly. I was trying not to act like a fool so I very humbly thanked him and told him I wouldn't let him down. Once the phone hit the receiver though I confess I danced a little jig. This was going to be a BIG promotion with a lot more pay/benefits, as well as responsibility. The papers to sign arrived and I quickly signed. After the secretary left I rang up my wife and told her to find her nicest dress, we were going out to celebrate tonight. When she asked what for, I sprung the good news on her and I had to move the phone away from my head as she squealed in delight. We'd been scrimping and saving for awhile now, and had been hoping to take a nice vacation. After telling her goodbye I leaned back in the chair and imagined what my new office would look like. I could almost smell the fine furniture and feel the aged oak desk beneath my fingers. Maybe I'd even have a nice little plaque with my name emblazoned on it? I chuckled a bit at how cliche it all seemed and got back to work. After all that, the last thing I needed was to mess up and get fired!",4,"My boss call me to discuss some projects at work and then while we are discussing my diligence's he offers me a new position as the supervisor of the department, after I signed the papers I immediately called my wife and tell her the good news about this promotion at work.",90.0,0.024656848091741696,,0.015142922128314454,0.00815034839701291,0.011190349210450864,0.018776081148055655,,-0.009513925963427242,-0.016506499694728786,-0.013466498881290832,-0.005880766943686042,306,17,4.029411764705882,0.6111111111111112,33,18.0,1,31,29,0,2

My Manager ask me if we can have a quick meeting today to discuss some personal projects about my development here at work, and at the beginning of the meeting everything went smoothly, we were talking about new projects that were coming up and how I was doing in my current role. Then he tells me, what do you think if I offer you a supervisory position of the department? I was in shock and my answer was of course yes, this is the opportunity that I was looking for since I start in this company, all the hard work finally pay off. Then he makes me sign a paper with my salary increase and the new title. At that moment I was shaking and feeling anxious because this is an important moment of my life, and that I know that I have the potential to do more here in the company. After I signed those papers I tell thank you to my boss for this amazing opportunity of advancement in my career and I will never let him down in my new position. He said congratulations you deserve it, and I want to see more awesome things here at work. Then I left his office and I immediately called my wife and tell her the notice of my promotion and she was so happy because it is a new chapter for our life, with our new baby and kid, more money for the family and a bright future here in the company. It is a very emotional moment for me and my family, that I will never forget. After that I called my dad and mom to tell them the notice of my promotion here at work, my mom was all happy and she was telling how smart I'm and to be thankful with God for every step that I do at my career here at work. In the other hand my dad was kind of surprised, but he told me to shot for the top, keep fighting for your dreams and keep fighting for your family, because at the end they are all depending in your salary/money for a place to live, pay rent, groceries, entertainment.

She shared things with me that none of my siblings knew. Just typing this makes me cry. Hearing your mother's heart beat stop is something I'll never forget. I still go to call her on the phone at least 3 times a week. I wish my own adult children called me. They think texting is the same as speaking. In my opinion it can't replace hearing the sound of a loved ones voice-the inflection, the expression. Christmas was terrible. Just my husband and me.. Our cairn terrier died recently. New Year's Eve was even worse. My godchild who is a medical fellow who lives about 2 hours from here begged me to come to her house  because her husband, also a fellow, accused her of something she didn't do -so absolutely outrageous and left. So she paid for me to come by Uber. Happy New Year. Her parents were born in India and they don't believe that she wants a divorce and keep telling her what a good guy he is. At one time I thought so too, but now  I think he's a major control freak. . I know their marriage has made her unhappy and know more about this than her parents  do, but the Indian culture is so different She was raised here.. She needs to be her own person.  My mother was very close to her and her husband of 4 years because they were medical residents where my family lives. She counseled both of them many times....also fed them:-) Wherever her spirit is I know she's flipping out about this. Of course he returned to the house after I left the next evening but notg to speak to her or to try to fix this broken marriage, but to mentally abuse her.  Yesterday I was sitting outside in the sun and a hummingbird kept flying back and forth close to my face. This is very unusual. Then it landed on my left shoulder. I think it was my mother.

FOUR MONTHS.  I mean, it started so badly, you know? Internet dating is one thing, but ""finding random person on Craigslist"" sounds like the beginning of one of those murder/investigation shows on television, but no. She was a real person who just wanted someone to go to a concert with her so she wouldn't have to go alone. Emily's cool, though, so no ""my wife is an axe murderer"" here.  Not that I probably wouldn't deserve it, but I won't complain.  I mean, I ruined the concert and she's already forgiven met--it's not like I could have predicted the stomach flu, but I probably could have managed not to puke on her shoes--and she was awesome about things when the tire went flat.  She was like Superwoman, swinging the tire iron around like she knew exactly what to do with it (even though she told me she'd never changed a tire before.) I don't think I could have written a worst first date.  Maybe accidental broken bones or a trip to the ER, but puke and flat tires run a close second.

I was heading to the movies with a friend who had been begging me to go see it for days, although now I can't even fully recall which it was. There wasn't a lot of time for me to think as I was still groggy, so I quickly went back inside to grab a cup of coffee before heading out. Turning on the machine and hearing it whirr to start up I decided that I would also flick on the television real fast just to see what was going on in the world. I honestly can't remember what I saw, as my mind is blurry from the entire thing but I do remember it being quite boring to the point of remarkability, but what did stick out was the traffic alert. We were going to be late to the movie if we didn't leave soon so I quickly grabbed whatever coffee had been finished and rushed out the door having a completely black cup of joe that I didn't even want anymore. My friend was waiting for me at her house when I picked her up and was a bit annoyed that I was late, but I didn't think much of it. Now this is the part that really, really stuck out to me. Right as she got into the car, her daughter quickly ran outside and called her back in. When she came back out she was bright red and told me that she couldn't go, that she had to stay home and didn't want to explain but I was adamant and so she did. Apparently the babysitter couldn't make it in time and so it was all a bust, but instead of letting her feel bad I drove home real quick and picked up a blu-ray of a movie that I figured she would enjoy and drove back to her house. At this point you can probably realize this isn't exactly just a friend, but someone who I had wanted to impress and so when I returned and showed her the blu-ray we watched it together and it was a pretty awesome experience. The entire time all I could think was about how lucky I was to be in this house with her and her family, who seemed to be pretty receptive of me. Anyways, once this was all over instead of leaving she offered for me to stay for dinner and this is the first time I would ever have a meal with her alone as her daughter took a nap right after eating a few minutes earlier. This is so memorable for me because it was the first experience that I had in a romantic setting with this woman who I am now currently dating and I'll never forget it.",3,"I was going to go on a date with a woman but things didn't go as planned.

It was a great way to get away from the family, and I was very thrilled to be doing so. I brought my larger tent, as I felt the 2-man tent was not going to cut it. I had to find a clearing in the woods so that I could place it, and there was a nice spot about 300 feet in from the road. However, it was overshadowed by a 25 foot dead pine tree that was in the process of falling over. I pulled out my axe and helped it, knocking it down in about 10 minutes of work. I had to use my saw in certain parts due to the way the tree was angled. Once I finally got it down, I had plenty of firewood at my disposal, right next to my camp! I proceeded to de-limb the tree for kindling, and then sawed the larger main trunk of the tree for actual firewood. After clearing the area for about an hour, I now had a nice flat place to put my tent. I pitched my tent after sweeping the area with a few branches. When that was done, I decided to scour the area for large stones so that I could build a fire pit. I found about a dozen decent sized stones and carried them back to the campsite. I dug a small pit and arranged the stones around it, a wonderful start to my camping trip. From that point on, it was basically cooking, enjoying the scenery, and being along with my thoughts. I did some scouting around the area and found a very old graveyard, which I estimated to be at least 140 years old! The strange thing is that it was on top of a mountain, so someone had to come up here to build it. I feel it was an appropriate place, as the area was quite beautiful and had a wonderful view. I really enjoyed my camping trip up in the woods and got some much needed relaxation and time to myself, without the chattering of my wife and children to distract me. I plan on doing this again and cannot wait until my next trip.",1,"I went camping up in the woods by myself. Felling a tree, cooking my own food, and being one with nature.

We have known each other for over 6 years now and she feels more like a sister than a friend to me. We first met in college, back in the day, two young girls barely entered the new world met and started the journey together. At first, I didn't like her at all and it was for no reason. However, after spending years studying together, we gradually got close. As I stood next to her, I was overwhelmed with feelings. I witnessed her with every guy she dated, for countless time I comforted her while she cried over a heartbreak. However, today, someone deserves her finally came and took her hand. I remembered back when they first started dating, out of my protecting instinct, I was skeptical about the new guy. I was worried he would break her heart again just like her exes. Over the time, he proved himself that not only he deserves her, but also he's the best one you can think of as her husband. I looked at my best friend getting married to her love when unexpectedly, a baby cried out loud right after she said ""I do"" to her husband. Everyone almost laughed out loud due to the coincidence. Obviously, the a crying kid is never pleasant but because of the oddly right timing, it had become one of the most memorable events at the wedding. During that time, I couldn't help but thinking about my own special day and hopefully, my best friend will be there with her family.",5,I was the Maid of Honor in my best friend's wedding.

He worked at an electronic shop as a sales representative so he did not make enough money yet he spends much more than he earns. It was that bad that i sometimes began to imagine how Jennifer managed to put up with all of his excesses .The most devastating problem about Nathan was that he was a chronic womanizer. In the course of there relationship he has cheated on Jennifer more than seven times, the ones i can still remember or would i say the ones he was caught and could not deny them. Jennifer was sometimes traumatized and always caught in an emotional blackmail. She suffered a lot during the six years of there relationship. I could not understand why she keeps condoling his act of cheating on her. So one day she cried and came to me to complain about how Nathan has just cheated on her i was so mad at her, Nathan and her entire relationship that i screamed at her attempting to give a  piece of my mind. I asked her what she was doing with that good for nothing man, she told me she loved him so much and that she has tried to stop loving him but cannot. the more she tries the more the love increases and how she can not live without him . In frustration i told her to leave my house and that i did not want to hear about Nathan and her relationship with him ever again. both after two years their relationship was still on. Nathan had apologized to her and she forgave him as always and there were back together. Nathan got some religion into his life, he is now a christian. Jennifer told me how everything about Nathan has tremendously changed. I saw the joy i hadn't seen in her for a long time i was happy for her. I was so shocked one morning when she told me that Nathan proposed and she accepted and she would want me to be her maid of honor on her wedding day i was honored to do it and so i was the Maid of Honor in my best friend's wedding.

I was super excited for her and her husband-to-be. The time came for the ceremony and I walked down the aisle before my best friend.

About 10 minutes on our way back, we heard beeping behind us from multiple cars.

Everyone ended up being alright, but it was pretty terrifying at the time.  It happened at night near the mall a few blocks from where I live.  We had just seen a movie and were coming back to my house when we were hit out of nowhere.  The driver of the other car got out and was visibly intoxicated.  He seemed very nervous and wanting to get out of there before the cops arrived.  There were some cops right down the street so it didn't take them long to arrive.  They asked a few questions and took a few pictures.  I saw in the distance that they were giving the other driver a field sobriety test.  After that, I just remember seeing them put the other driver in handcuffs and loading him into the back of a cruiser.  It actually ended up being a bit fortuitous, in that we received a decent payout from the other driver's insurance, most likely because he had been intoxicated.  Neither of us have any lasting injuries.  I had a little soreness in my neck for a few days, but the doctor said it was just some minor whiplash.  I actually haven't even thought about it since the last time I did the essay, since there really wasn't any lasting consequences.

I was driving with my brother back from the movie theater when we were sideswiped by another car.  It spun us around into the median and was completely terrifying.  It really came out of nowhere and gave me no time to react or take any preventative measures.  We both looked at each other shocked when we came to a stop.  We checked on each other to make sure we were both okay, which we were.  We got out of my car to assess the damage and make sure the other driver was okay.  They other driver got out of their car and were obviously under the influence.  You could see the wobble in them from 20 feet away.  My car, which was pretty new, was smashed in the rear driver side, but not as bad as I would have thought.  The other driver looked to be in his mid 20s and started to freak out a bit when he realized that we were calling the police.  The police go there really quickly and gave the guy a field sobriety test which he failed miserably.  I exchanged information with on of the officers while we waited for a tow truck to come.  The other driver was arrested and my car was towed away.  It is the only major accident I've ever been in besides one or two small fender benders in parking lots.  Surprisingly, my car was mostly okay.  It's a 2012 Subaru Legacy that I spent a lot of time saving up for.  I'm not entirely sure what happened to the other driver, but his insurance settled out with us.  Ironically, my car was salvaged out about a month later due to hail damage (somehow that was more costly than this accident).",2,"I was in a car accident coming home from the movies with my brother about 3 months ago.

This isn't like Kate, but I know she just broke up with her boyfriend and has been argumentative with most of us so I've basically written it off as a one-shot problem with her. In the last six months, she's finally been her normal self with everyone including me. Anyway, a couple of my teammates and I were at a party and a video of that particular game was being played and I watched that fight again. I'm very frustrated at myself.

It was Ann who started the fight very subtly and unnoticeable but definitely showed running the video slowly. The referee, Ohio State's captain and I were all wrong and Ann, the player had lied.

I messaged the person, and they said they'd love to join. Actually, it seemed like they were too enthusiastic about the meetup. This led to some high anxiety on my part, since I tend to be skeptical. I asked myself questions like ""Is this invitation socially acceptable?"" and ""Why is this person so eager to meet us?"". Luckily, my wife was able to talk out the doubt and reduce my apprehension toward the situation. So, we got ready, my wife being a little late as usual, and took a taxi downtown to meet our new friend. As we arrived to the restaurant, our new friend and us both got out of the taxis at the same time, so we had a good laugh. From then on, the night seemed to go rather smoothly. We talked about our lives and our interests, and there seemed to be a real friendship budding. After a few drinks, we decided to call it a night and exchanged more contact information.

We don't have a ton of money to spend on vacation, so any little trip is a big deal for us. Also we totally suck at planning things, and hadn't done anything all summer, until we really buckled down and started making a cohesive plan. We splurged and got a hotel near the park for two nights, and invited a friend of ours from Tennessee to come stay with us too. His name was Nick, and we'd never met him.	That is to say, we met him on Twitch. Karl and I started streaming a little over a year ago, and while I got bored of it fairly quickly, he kept at it and ended up starting a small group of streamers. Nick was one of the first members added to the group, all of us fans of the game Dropmix (a strange music/card game hybrid). In the months that followed we would all become closer watching each others stream at different times of the day, keeping each other company at work and so on. So when we invited him to stay with us, we felt like we knew him.	I would describe myself as having a high degree of social anxiety. I had some hesitation about meeting someone in real life who only knew me from my online persona.	But it ended up being awesome! Karl, Nick, and myself all share a love of roller coasters in addition to weird card games, and surprisingly none of us had ever been to Kentucky Kingdom before. The lines were short and they offered free soda to visitors from out of town (I won't say no!), the rides were awesome, and the people-watching was on point. The only drawback to the whole thing was that Nick and Karl both snore. But I'd had enough to drink each night that it wasn't much of an issue. I ended up feeling glad that we rallied and planned a trip, however quaint. It's something more people should try. Even just a few days away with friends made the stressful reality of day to day life a little more tolerable.",1,"My partner and I, despite being lazy, planned a trip with a friend we'd only met online.

Through talking with the admission officers and touring students, we captured a lot of information about admission policy, documents need to be prepared, majors, and student campus life. It was very helpful for my child to select ones they are interested in and would pursue their studies in the future. It is is very important to touch these necessary information early prior to their application deadlines. We drove to a few cities nearby where the universities we are interested in located. We visited 2 schools each day during this trip. We first visited a few schools on the east coast, then visited others on the southwest side. A few Ivy leagues schools were included into this trip. According to the well known rule, we divided these schools into three categories, reach, match, and safe to schedule our visit concentrations. For a reach school, we focused on to learn more about the admission policy. For a match or safe school, we concentrated on the required documents including SAT test scores. During the visit, we figured out which major could be more promising one when applying for a reach school, considering as a premed track student later on. For a match or safe school, we strictly followed up the most interested major such as Biomedical engineering in one engineering school. We compared the similar ranks of schools in terms of student population size, campus life, major strength, faculty to student ratio etc. We finally narrowed down to 10 schools in our list. One of things need to mentioned especially here: be sure to check in on time prior to your information session. For example, WashU treated a campus visiting as the demonstrated interesting of a student on them. Some of schools followed up us after our campus visiting. It is also useful for a family to on-site check the student residence and meal plan in one specific school.

My kids are ready going to their college in next a few year. We scheduled for 9 university information sessions and the corresponding campus tours during this trip. We have greatly enjoyed this impressive and informative trip. We directly contacted with the teachers and students from these universities and learned a lot of new information about our interested university. This was a very important visit for my kids to prepare their university applications later on. As their parents, we also felt this visit was very helpful for us to prepare for the coming important events. We learned how to start the preparations for the promising universities earlier. My son has been aiming on his dream school, MIT, because his friends went to this school. I helped him to sort the candidate majors out and went through the admission pages carefully. After talked with the teachers and students there, my son recognized what were his strengths and weaknesses. He said he would start preparations of his standardized tests more earlier. He have made a detail plan for the next 3 years for this endeavor. I thought that it would be better for a family to arrange this kind of campus visit more earlier, i.e. 3 years prior to the university application. This kind of activities obviously encouraged my kids to be more active on their studies. As parents, we also could help them in more specific manors instead of non-focused ways. Through these visits, my kids had their direct experiences with the university campus life. We learned more detail about their interested majors in the candidate universities instead of just numbers such as accept rate and university ranking. We would narrow down the school list and re-visit some of them in the future. In summary, this trip was a very important for us to help the kids to prepare their college application in the coming years.",1,It is important for a high school student to make a detail plan on his preparation of college application.

My best friend, John, suggested our friend's group should take a unique vacation earlier this year, and he heard good things about these new rock cruises where you travel with the band. I am pretty much open to any type of music anyway, but rock is easily near the top of my list of genres. I really started getting excited when I found out the band involved was one of my favorite rock bands from the 80's. Aside from the water part, I was a fairly easy sell. Within minutes of getting on the ship we all realized how unbelievable this experience would be. In addition to nightly performances from the band, the whole band mingled with everyone just like regular people throughout the entire trip. I remember walking into the bathroom and having to wait for the lead singer to finish before I could use the toilet. I felt funny about shaking his hand at the time, and was left speechless as he walked off. Thankfully I had a chance to introduce myself later on in the trip! All of my friends had a blast on the cruise too, and I barely even noticed the fact that we were so far out on the water. The last night ended up being a massive blowout concert that seemed to go on for hours. The atmosphere was so perfect that I'm not sure it's possible to ever forget how great the experience was. To think I might have skipped out on this trip due to my fear of water is almost crazy now. I consider this to be arguably my best vacation of my entire life, and I might just have to try another one when this band comes around again!",1,I went on a rock cruise with some friends.

I go to many concerts and it is one of my favorite things to do so I knew I could really enjoy this experience. From seeing band members at the airport when I landed to being in the same boarding group I was excited for the week. There were bands on the cruise who I had been a fan of for years and they were all very accessible and laid back that you could sit and chat with them just like they are a regular person. There was one band in particular who I enjoyed and I was really looking forward to and they were only doing one performance on the cruise the first night. It was in a small lobby area with open balconies looking down, the area was packed full and the performance seemed so intimate and special that I still get goosebumps thinking about it. The singer commented that they were just guys who like sitting around a fire with an acoustic guitar and singing so they were going to do a sing-along, he and one of the guitarists sat on the bar and sang a cover and had everyone watching join in. All the concerts I go to and this was by far one that I will never forget. One other really unique part of this cruise is that they not only have complete bands but they also have individual musicians who do an all star jam type performance of famous covers. Before going I was told to not miss those performances and I made sure to watch each time they had one and was not disappointed at all. I have talked with bands since the cruise when they came to my city on tour and they all talk fondly about what a great time they had so it's really cool that both bands and attendees all have great experiences. The other thing that I really enjoyed is that anywhere you went during the cruise; the dining room or off the boat at ports, you would run into band members who were just having a great time and enjoying their vacation as well. There were no egos at all. We have booked to go back on the cruise next year and I'm getting excited because it's getting closer. I feel like I almost planned too much for this past year and now I know that it's ok to just go with the flow and relax.",3,I went on a rock cruise with some friends.

One of my friends had posted a youtube video from last year's and another friend commented that she really wanted to go on it sometime so I replied that if she was serious we should plan it because I really wanted to as well. The two of us, the original friend who posted it and another friend of theirs were able to get a quad cabin and go. I wasn't sure what to expect and was a little nervous about what to pack or what the experience would be like. I have gone to lots of concerts for year and I always am happy and comfortable at rock concerts. From the time we got on the boat I felt at home and like I was meant to be there. The first night of the cruise one of the bands I was most interested in seeing was doing a performance in a pretty small lobby area so I made sure to get there early so I could get a spot; I was able to get a spot on the stairs looking down on the stage and the performance was nothing less than chill inducing. You could feel the passion in their performance and everyone watching was locked in enjoying it. At one point the singer said that they were just a bunch of Texas boys used to sitting around a campfire with an acoustic guitar and beers and singing, he and one of the guitarists went and sat on the bar and did what turned into a singalong of a classic rock song. Everyone in that lobby area all the way up to the balconies looking down was signing along. I felt at home and actually teared up at what a special moment it was. Throughout the cruise we would run into band members all over the place; in the dining hall, at the ports, in the casino, just hanging out and they were all nice as could be.  I left my phone in my cabin most of the time and wasn't even concerned with taking photos or videos of performances, I just lived in the moment. I stood and talked with band members of bands who I have been a fan of for years and they seemed to have a genuine interest in what we were talking about, I got to meet people I never would have dreamed of meeting and I discovered some new bands. Since the cruise ended I bought a meet and greet for one of the bands when they were in my town and I mentioned that we ""vacationed together"" and all of them lit up talking about the experience. One of the members of the band had been sitting behind me with his girlfriend at a comedy show and I offered to buy them drinks, just because I'm a fan and appreciate what their music has gotten me through and done for me. With no prompting, he looked at me and said, ""Wait. I remember you, you bought me a beer! My girlfriend and I really appreciated that!"" and we had more of a conversation about the cruise. I figured I would have a good time and I always wanted to go on this cruise because it is very popular in the rock community. I had an even better time than I imagined I would. I walked around the entire time with a smile on my face and I am going back next year!",1,I went on a rock cruise with some friends.

Even though safety issues began to happen more and more, our supervisor simply kept piling on more work. Her boss told her it wasn't important and we could skip doing it, but my supervisor wanted to impress everyone and be ""number 1"" so she ignored all advice. Whispers began behind her back, the other pharmacists began to worry about their licenses but the pressure just kept mounting. I found the wrong pills in a bottle on the shelf and my supervisor got mad at me, even though I had not filled from that bottle at all that week. Nothing was ever mentioned again and I began to lie awake at 3 in the morning wondering if the wrong medication had gone out unnoticed before or since. This income was so important to my family, the job was so important to my self-worth but I knew if anything happened I would be liable no matter who was truly at fault. My job had been toxic to begin with, my supervisor was abusive and infamous in our company for being a nasty person. My coworkers trained me by yelling at me and then arguing and ranting with each other in Spanish about me. But I persisted, I did not want to let them win. Every morning I hoped I would get in a car wreck serious enough that I could not work for the foreseeable future. I snapped at my husband, I snapped at my child. Every moment not spent at work was filled with crushing dread that I would have to go back in a few hours. My marriage suffered greatly, my self-esteem was trashed. Yet still I kept on. But that one little tablet of Tramadol was enough to snap me out of it. I was terrified, someone with over a decade of experience had mistakenly put a controlled substance into a bottle of blood pressure medication. And no one caught it. The counts of the controlled medication done every day weren't off? That seemed odd to me, every tablet of those is so tightly accounted for that someone either counted wrong or they noticed but didn't have time to deal with the paperwork so they brushed it aside. How many times had it happened before? Why was I being blamed? These questions ate at me and ate at me until I realized I was killing myself for a job that would throw me under the bus even knowing criminal charges could be brought against me when I didn't do anything wrong.

I was on the phone, helping a patient, and also filling prescriptions as fast as I could. The pharmacist in charge (PIC) was picking her nose while telling me to go faster, faster, faster. I felt so angry that she wouldn't even pick up the phone and put someone on hold while us techs were working at such dangerous paces. And then it happened. A customer asked me to count their pills again so they knew they were receiving the right amount. I understood why, we were visibly overworked and understaffed, but was also very irritated at having yet another task added to my plate. I grabbed the vial, dumped it out, and then my blood ran cold. The PIC stopped digging in her nose and looked down at the same time I did--she lead by micromanaging us right down to how many times a day we urinated, and she started whisper yelling at me. There was a very dangerous drug mixed in with the blood pressure pills. How it happened, who initially put the wrong drug in the wrong bottle, who verified it at the final check, it didn't matter. This was not a failure of the multi-step process or the team in her eyes. No, the fault was mine and mine alone. My bladder was strained, my feet hurt, and I could not safely multitask another day. I went home and thought about it, obsessed over it, dreamed about it. I showed up for work the next day and worried over every patient. I worried that the other techs were not able to work safely either, that the other pharmacists were so worried about whether patients were coming in for vaccinations to meet a goal that I was actually going to kill someone next time. I worried that someone was sitting down to take the wrong medicine right that moment and there was nothing I could do.  The next day was my day off and I felt dread, crippling dread. And then I woke up at 3 in the morning and realized I didn't have to go in the next day. I didn't have to go back ever again. So without warning, without thought I quit. Just like that.

Often my mail is consumed with junk and most of it gets tossed into the recycling, but on this particualr day, there was a golden letter that I couldn't have been happier about receiving.  It was a letter informing me that the school was re-opening its doors.  This meant I my days of homeschooling were coming to an end!  A year earlier, I had learned that the school my children were going to was closing.  Major repairs needed to be done on the school and I had to find an alternative for my children.  I looked and looked for good alternatives, but there were none.  I live in a small town and the closest school was miles away.  It just wasn't feasable to drive my kids to school when it would take us an hour to get there and an hour to get back.  Hence, my journing into the world of homeschooling began.  I didn't want to homeschool because I knew it would be difficult.  My children were used to the routine of public school and not their mom being their teacher.  How was I supposed to keep them engaged and interested in learning when they are at home?  The distractions in the house were too great with all their electronic devices.  I decided that I had to become two different people, mom and teacher.  I also had to designate an area of the house as the school zone.  Despite this, my children had a hard time adjusting to me being their teacher.  They would wine about the homework and compare me to what it was like when they were attending public school.  I had to remind them over and over why we were doing things they way we were.  I think it took us a good couple of months to really get into the flow of homeschooling.  It wore me out to homeschool.  I did enjoy having my children home, but it was exhasting mentally and physically.  I was used to some quiet time during the day, but now my day was full of teaching my own children.  So on that blessed day close to two months ago when I recieved that letter informing me that the school was going to re-open, I jumped for joy.  It isn't that I didn't like being with my children everyday and teaching them, it was difficult.",1,"I had to homeschool my children for a year because their school had closed.

So before I even had kids, the thought was playing in my mind, ""What if we can't afford private education and I HAVE TO homeschool?"" And sure enough, it did happen. After 3 good years of having my kids at that nice little school, it closed. I signed up with a homeschooling site and purchased materials. I studied them, prepared for the school year, and for the whole year, I persevered, doing it the best I could. I am sorry to say I did hate it.

She always has a great party at her house. I was uneasy about the costume I had selected since I had not really put in too much effort or time into it. I was dressed up as John Snow from Game of Thrones. I have the long black hair and the facial hair naturally so that was a plus. What I was uneasy about was the clothing. I had visited a Thrift Store two days before the event and had hurriedly pieced together a  ""John Snow costume"". I arrived about an hour before the party officially started to help my friend with last minute items. I was ""in between"" girlfriends so was going as ""a single guy"". To my surprise, I met a girl with incredible inner and outer beauty and a great spirit. Her name was Elyse and was my friend's cousin.  Elyse and I were exchanging looks and glances from across the room with curiosity or possibly interest in each other. I hesitated in interacting with Elyse, the way I really wanted to, since I felt my John Snow costume looked ""cheap"". I was self-conscious due to the costume so only interacted with Elyse a couple of times. I interacted with everybody else but Elyse seemed to be the one I wanted to get to know better. I knew then that it was because I had a serious interest in her and wanted to make a good impression. The evening progressed and I did manage to dance with Elyse once. One of our co-workers ended up talking with Elyse a lot and danced with her several times. The party ended and everybody went home. I saw my co-worker and Elyse talking and walking together and I knew then that I had hesitated due to a lack of self-confidence created by my ""cheap"" John Snow costume. Elyse ended up dating my co-worker for about 2-3 months but they never really ""clicked"". I ended up dating a great girl I met at an NFL Game House Party in November and have been with her since. I still think about Elyse but more importantly, I think about my hesitation to really be myself that night, as I typically am, and loosing an opportunity of dating ""the women that caught my eye and brightened my spirit"" on that memorable Halloween House Party night. It was all due to a lack of confidence / self-esteem brought about a poor choice of costume. I will never let what I am wearing dictate how I truly act or will I allow it to prevent me from being myself.",1,About confidence and self-esteem is affected  in my life.

I see so much sadness from people with so much potential, and so much goodness. Overtime, I realized that a lot of this comes from a lack of self-love and self-confidence. I began watching endless ted talks about confidence, openness, and outreach. From this I have created a montra for myself that defines how I live. “Be so confident and so grounded in yourself, that you are able to love others regardless of division, jealously, or judgement.” I try to live by these words every day. To be proud of who I am, and what I have to offer the world. And by becoming confident in my life, I am able to inspire confidence in others. I am able to show others their potential and goodness regardless of how different they are than me. I am able to be genuinely happy and proud of others when they do better than me. I am able to reach out to others regardless if others will judge me for doing so. Confidence in myself has inspired me to be a better person, to live a better life, and to make the world a better place. you want to be happy and successful person, it is so important to keep believing in yourself and stay self-confident. What you need for this? Just be faithful to yourself and your own values, always do your best and don't try to avoid mistakes, as we can learn more from our failures then from our achievements. The Dalai Lama says “Self-confidence is knowing that you have the capacity to do something and deciding not to give up.” so trust your self first. Two main things contribute to self-confidence: self-efficacy and self-esteem. We gain a sense of self-efficacy when we see ourselves",3,About confidence and self-esteem is affected  in my life.

People who are abusive like to build themselves up by putting others down. They often want you to feel bad about yourself, and try to do things to bring you down. your own ‘inner voice’ – if you focus on negative things, or tell yourself that you are hopeless or that you are to blame for everything that goes wrong, then this can also lower your confidence and self-esteem. In turn, this can affect how you relate to others. You might find yourself trying too hard to please others. You might think your needs don’t matter, so you don’t stand up for yourself. You can change your ‘inner voice’ and think more positively about yourself. How are you thinking? Don’t be hard on yourself or focus on mistakes. Don’t blame yourself for the way other people act­. If someone has put you down, bullied you or hurt you, it says more about them than it does about you. Focus on positive things like your achievements and good qualities. Try Dear Diary: feeling better about myself. If a little voice inside your head says “But I was so stupid/weak/dumb to put up with that” (or something like that), fight back! Remind yourself: there’s nothing wrong with hoping someone will change, or giving someone a second (or seventh!) chance. When someone has treated you badly it can be hard to know what to say or do – there’s nothing wrong with feeling confused. What’s wrong is the abuse. Tell yourself that you don’t deserve to be treated this way. Believe it’s not your fault. The other person has done the wrong thing – not you! Be proud of the way you’ve been able to be strong and of the ways you have found to keep going while dealing with the stress and trauma of the abuse. Ways to feel betterGet involved in something that interests you and that helps you connect with other people, like a sport or a hobby.

It was my sister, her boyfriend, and myself getting ready to enjoy a very American vacation. The next day was the 4th of July fireworks on the lake. The town had a special event every year where people would take their families out on the boats and huddle up in a cove near the town fairgrounds. From the fairgrounds they would launch off tons and tons of fireworks. All in perfect view for the huddled up boats. It was incredible to watch and such a unique experience. There were more boats than I ever remembered there being in the past. Boats blast off their own choice of song as the nearly 45 minute show continued, much to the enjoyment of everyone after a 10 minute disappointing show the previous year. Many people would bring foods to snack on and some would even have grills aboard their boats. It was such an American smell. The smell of fireworks, delicious food and a summer breeze. Seeing the fireworks reflect off the water is truly something else. You could also relax in the water on a raft during the show with the pitch black water below. It's truly a one of a kind experience unique to the area and something I'd gladly do again next year.

We wait for fireworks, launched off by the city just after the moon rises. The fireworks the previous year were notably short to the disbelief of the boat goers.

I recently got divorced and was ready for big changes in my life. As I lay in bed I wondered what I could do, I felt suffocated for years while married and for the first time in a long time I felt free. Free to do whatever I wanted, I am not getting any younger I thought to myself. I got out of bed and went through my drawer for old diaries, I thought I would relive one of my best memories. Maybe go to six flags or.. as I opened the diary the first page I saw was about some goals I had years ago. In that entry.. travel the world was #2. You see I always wanted to travel the world I but my ex husband put me off of it by telling me we had no money or savings for things like that.  As I stood there looking at my old diary I decided that I wanted to make that my number one goal for right NOW! I went downstairs, made myself a cup of coffee and jumped into the shower. I was exited about the possibility of travelling, I could leave everything behind and start over again some place else. My thoughts went everywhere, I wondered which country I would visit first, if I should look for air bnb or stay at a hotel. How much money do I have and where can I get more money from. With my thoughts all over the place. I got out of the shower, got dressed and started my research. I opened my laptop and went on to youtube and the first video I saw was about a could who sold everything and traveled the world for 9 months. As if this was my fate, I took this as a sign that I too should do this. I called up a friend who is a realtor and asked her to list my three bedroom starter home. She was confused and wanted to go out for a drink but I had allot to do and explained to her that I need to sell my furniture and everything inside my house and if we could have coffee at my house anytime she is free. She came over within an hour and thought I was going crazy. She did help me and knew of a family that might be interested in purchasing my house. Over the next few days I spend my time between cleaning, selling and getting organized. The family who were interested in purchasing came to have a look at it while I was still getting organized. The family were in urgent need of a place to live as they were moving from a different state but nothing could have prepared me for selling my house within 3 weeks and with a cash sale.",4,"I spontaneously listed my home for sale which ended up working out too fast with a cash sale and a 3 week closing,",42.0,0.026320160114361595,,0.007011565778157092,0.006838152163254563,0.01409699702586901,0.019068077751702123,,-0.019308594336204504,-0.019482007951107033,-0.012223163088492585,-0.007252082362659472,485,24,3.9237113402061854,0.4948453608247423,40,20.208333333333332,1,64,53,0,1

This home had 4 acres and a 6 car garage which we fell in love with.  After a visit to a bank for a pre approval we have decided to list our home as for sale by owner on zillow make me move to make the offer seem better contingent on sale of our home. The evening of us making an offer on the house we liked they have accepted an offer overbidding the asking price. Being that our home was still on the market on zillow I had a realtor reach out to me to show the house to his client. A few days later a lady came with her realtor and spent about an hour touring the home.  By the end of the tour she deicded to buy the house for full asking price for a cash deal. I was really surprised and thrown off by this especially since there was no other lined up home for us to purchase. I could not say no to an offer that was presented even with circumstances of us not having anywhere to go at the moment. Because the deal was a cash sale there was not much but a home inpection and closing date was chosen 3 weeks from signing the sale agreement. In the span of 3 weeks we found a rental with only a week left to closing. In a manner of 1 day we moved the entire home into a very nice rental while we shop for a new home. The whole course of the three weeks before closing were extremely stressful and chaotic in midst of trying to find a rental that quickly and hoping things would not fall through with inspection or the sale after signing a lease and moving all our belongings.

While doing so I listed my house for sale by owner. While a house I wanted to purchase did not work out my home still was for sale online and someone decided to see it.  A few days later a lady came over to look at the house with her realtor. She spent about an hour there checking it out. About an hour after leaving her realtor called and they put a cash offer on my house that I could not refuse. Because she was a cash buyer the sale of the house was scheduled within 3 weeks of signing the agreement. I went from casually looking for a house to 3 weeks out from the sale. I had to quickly find a rental while I look for my new house. It took me almost 10 days to find a place that I wanted to sign a lease for but I did end up finding one. Between getting the keys and signing the papers I had a total of 6 days to move my entire home.  The home inspection went well then it was down to the closing. The closing went smoothly and I walked out no longer being a home owner. Definitely a really random and stressful situation that worked great in my favor. All in all it was a great success.,1,"I spontaneously listed my home for sale which ended up working out too fast with a cash sale and a 3 week closing,",42.0,0.023157881883283455,,0.004623452626886623,0.01499934551587406,0.013650470327896376,0.013620520809975762,,-0.018534429256396832,-0.008158536367409396,-0.009507411555387079,-0.009537361073307693,231,15,3.9177489177489178,0.5714285714285714,15,15.4,1,18,23,0,0

I wanted to have the most perfect wedding with my fiance. This didn't quite happen the way we wanted, and there was a few things that dampened our spirits. Let me start by mentioning the worst part first. Most couples want a perfect wedding but I am sure that doesn't always happen. Here is what happened to us. My wedding morning started off terrible. It was not the best as far as weather goes. There was rain coming down, and thundering. Not only that but started at the same time as my ceremony, I mean exactly! That caused everyone to bring the chairs, and everything else including the food indoors. Then we waited til the storm left until we started it again. We dragged everything outside again instead of just having the wedding indoors. The greatest thing about it is that we saw a rainbow during the time of the marriage vows we exchanged, eventually. This sometimes means an old friend or relative who has passed is looking down upon us in heaven and smiling. That made me happy too.",3,"The morning of my wedding went very well, but it started to thunderstorm at the exact time of my ceremony.

I was monitoring the weather leading up to my wedding for weeks, as soon as I could see a two week forecast on Weather. com! The weather looked like it would be hot, but there did not seem to be any chance of thunderstorms until the day before the wedding. I wasn't too worried about it when I first woke up, because it was very sunny and hot out. My bridesmaids and I went to get our hair done, and my family went to the venue to start setting up. The day was already rushed because it is so easy to get behind and we had a strict deadline for when the wedding needed to be over. We finally arrived at the venue around 2pm. We began to take some family photos and some first look photos, and the day was still very sunny. I went inside to freshen up before the ceremony at 5, and I noticed it was starting to get darker and windy. I could hear commotion out in the hall, and finally, a huge crack of thunder. All of the guests had already arrived, so they ran to help my husband get the chairs out of the rain and into the banquet hall. They just made it before a deluge of rain. The storm passed in about 15 minutes, and then we had to set everything up outside again. However, the wedding really came together with all of our friends and family helping out. We only start the ceremony about 20 minutes late, and there was a rainbow there as we said our vows.

We had been engaged for almost 9 months, and I had been stressfully planning for the last 9 months. The day before the wedding started off stressful. We had an issue at the rehearsal dinner with our Officiant complaining and not being very supportive of all of the changing circumstances. He made me so mad because he was making the day all about him and how it wasn't easy for him, but it's our big day! I finally snapped, then went outside with my maid of honor to calm down. He finally apologized, then we went home to rest before the big day! The day of the wedding I woke up early because I couldn't sleep from excitement! I went to breakfast and met my bridesmaids and mother there. I could barely eat, but managed to have a biscuit and some eggs. We then went to the salon and it took almost four hours to get all of our hair and makeup done. We had a delicious Thai lunch, which was perfect, because that's some of my favorite food. We then got ready and headed over the venue. It was so crazy hot, so I was standing in front of the fan and putting my feet in ice water to try to stay cool! We got out photos done, behind schedule, but finally it was time to hide inside for the ceremony. People started arriving, but right at the time the ceremony was supposed to start, we had a huge thunderstorm! My husband had to run around getting everyone to help bring chairs inside. Luckily, the weather cleared shortly and we were able to get everything set up again and the ceremony started. It was beautiful, with a rainbow overhead and the bright sun coming out.

I came home from the movies to find my mother sitting on the sofa with a glass of wine on the coffee table, watching TV. She asked me how the gym was, as if that's something that she'd understand since she's the laziest person I know when it comes to exercise, and she sounded a little drunk. I could also smell wine from 10 feet away in the kitchen, and noticed an empty bottle on the counter. She'd drank the entire thing during the time before I left and while I was gone. She tried to ask me about my day when I realized she was totally drunk. Despite feeling great about having just worked out, my mood immediately shifted from being slightly annoyed about her having happy hour while I was away to livid about her being wasted for no apparent reason. I told her not to talk to me and she asked why; I briefly considered walking away from the situation. The anger welled up in me and I knew I had to give her a piece o my mind about what had become a disturbing habit of alcohol abuse. I raised my voice and told her it didn't matter how my day was, because she ruined it by getting excessively intoxicated when she knew it was something that greatly upset. She looked at me with an expression of confusion and sloppily said she was sorry. I yelled at her that she wasn't sorry because she kept behaving that way even though she knew how much it upset me, and it was better not to lie. I told her she was a selfish person and she had a problem, and if she was going to be a liar, she should learn to do a better job of it or just not talk to me at all. I grabbed my laptop and stormed out of the room, exiting to my bedroom. I went into my adjoining bathroom, slamming the door open so hard that it knocked the towel rack through the drywall.

It seems that the suspects were also accused of murdering a 17 year old girl in the same fashion about a couple of months before this one. Everyone was at ease learning that the perpetrators have been caught. However, a few months after the incident, the suspects were released. The police did not mention why or if they had any additional leads on the situation. To say the least, our community was up in arms about it. There were complaints to the police department, detective in charge and even to the mayor! It was all very confusing. Not only that, the released suspects weren't even charged in the previous incident before this one. We are all still in a state of shock over it. We are not sure what we are going to do.

It looked like someone was in my car. I got up to take a closer look and sure enough, two people were sitting in my car, rummaging through my belongs. Anger took over me, and without thinking, I ran downstairs to confront them. ""Hey, what the hell are you doing in my car? You know I'm a federal officer, and you just broke into my car??"" I said.

We luckily got finished moving things in pretty fast so after a shower and a little bit of time to relax, Celia offered to take me out around the neighborhood.

We had spent some time together, but not much as we lived so far away and I decided to move in with her never having even been to her place.  Around each corner she pointed out a room with little suggestions for what we would do in them.  She had an adorable way of showing the room where she would have both hands in the back pockets of her jeans or one and one arm embracing me, while she lifted up on her toes just a bit as she ended her sentences.  There was such joy in the air to finally be coming together and thinking of the possibilities that this flat would bring. This was not only me moving in with my partner, but this is the first partner I fully moved in with.  All my other relationships had stages where we would spend 12 or 14 days together or spend the night 5-10x in a row at the same place, but I never got to the stage where we were moved in and officially living together.  Not only was I making a big jump in my relationship, I was making a big jump in where I lived.   I moved away from my friends and family to live with Celia.  I did not know anyone in the city or region she lived in.  She is just so wonderful that I had to make this big change and take a chance on the love between us.  Later on that day, she would chop up a salad for us to have for dinner.  That was a big deal as her old roommate told me that was a surprise that she ""cooked"" so much for me.  It was a wonderful little meal and a sign of her trying to help me ease into the situation.  Washing the dishes it really was settling in that I was in a new place that was beginning to feel like a home.  After that we had our first Netflix and chill.

This is kinda weird, because this is the first time I have ever moved in with a partner. I have had partners where we would spend 10 straight nights together with Dayni or Olivia, but we never reached the point where we had a dresser or permanent spot for clothes/ accessories.   Walking through the door was such a rush of excitement and washing away of nerves to see the place I will be living in finally.  It is crazy to be moving all the way across the country to chase down a relationship, but this is a crazy amazing opportunity.  I'm so grateful that I decided to go off and take this risk as well as my parents supporting it.  There contribution to make this happen really makes it all possible.  The sadness of really having my friends and family so far gone, is at least now not present, because of my focus on the now. It's so reassuring to see Celia's perkiness and hear the positivity in her voice.  It is such a reaffirmation of the decision to watch her show me her place that she has shown me so much before but only through her phone.  It is midday and it is hot up here.  That doesn't get in the way of just pressing her body so tightly to the side of mine as she talks about each room.  The heat is like melting us together and I feel that close to her.  Just energy of joy is bounding through my body.  Each part of the tour is revealing a part of my future, however long or short it is. As the day goes on, I still feel like a guest in the house, but that feeling is slowly riding away.  Celia prepared a wonderful salad for us for dinner, which is just not her thing.  It was great though, because it was her way of going out of her way to make this a great first day.  Washing the dishes with her really made me feel closer and more part of the homeness that I hope to settle into.  Cuddling up to the first netflix and chill and this new place really has the sense of belonging taking over.  Finding a good groove to sit in felt like I was making a long term investment.  While she laid under my arm it placed over her like a puzzle piece fitting in. It feels like the right decision and that this is going to be a positive experience no matter how it ends.",2,"This is entry is about the first day of moving in to the place of my partner, Celia, which also happens to be a move across the country.

I've also seen the numerous depictions in film of McMurtry's stories. I first discovered the adventures of Call and McCrae in my freshman year of high school. My new girlfriend at the time (who considered herself a bit of a cowgirl) was obsessed with the series. She wasn't exaggerating to say she'd tried her hand at being a cowboy; she once joined an old fashioned cattle drive that took a herd of livestock from idaho to montana by horse. She was so taken by the series and it's characters that she even had her bicep tattooed with a full half-sleeve of McCrae rearing back on a horse. It was quite good work and I was quite jealous. I wouldn't mind going back to visit some of the timeless characters in those novels, they really do hold up in their unflinching depiction of the old american west, blemishes and all. Some of the most profound things I took from the stories were the details surrounding the cultures of the various native american tribes the cowboys encounter along the journeys. It's very interesting to know how the comanches and apaches were so desperately feared, and some other tribes simply were not as their way of life was much different. It also doesn't surprise me that plains native americans would be so tough and willing to fight to defend themselves given the overall harsh environment of north and west texas. One of the most striking moments in the series is when the long time adversary of Call and McCrae, the former chief of the comanches, is on his death-bed and seeks a personal journey to die alone and apart from his tribe. The cowboys have fought him for decades and want nothing but vengeance but they never get it. Instead the reader is treated to a profound moment of acceptance from an incredibly strong-willed man as he ushers himself from his world. It is truly one of my favorite books and having grown up in Texas, I some sense of pride imagining that events as romantic if at time brutal  probably took place. It makes me feel at the very least that Texas is as unique a state as we Texans would like to believe and often proclaim.",1,"I was very sad to have finished a long novel named ""Lonesome Dove"" by Larry McMurtry.

The two main characters are Gus and McCall.  They are aging ex-Texas Rangers that decide to go on one last adventure.  They decide to steal some cattle from Mexico and start a ranch in the northern U.S.  I think it as Montana.  The book had very rich character development.

It is difficult to even come up with a single favorite book but I did in this case. I liked it so much , maybe because at 59, I am aging and related well to the characters.  I am also a Texan.  Lonesome Dove is about two aging ex-Texas Rangers that feel the need to have one last great adventure.  This last adventure takes the form of a cattle drive from south Texas north to Montana (if memory serves me well).  There are many other characters involved with different backgrounds that could very well have books of their own.  The adventures abound and there really isn't a dull moment in the entire book.  Larry McMurtry excels at character development to the point that I felt as though I knew them.  He also excels at plots and sub-plots that are very compelling. While it isn't ""War and Peace"" long, it is a rather long book but I wished it was longer when I finished it.  I was very sad when I finished reading Lonesome Dove.  It was like losing a playmate, maybe even a friend.  I wondered what I was going to do for reading next.  I ended up researching similar books written by Larry McMurtry.  I did find other similar books that were written about the western United State at around the same time period but it just didn't match the colorful characters in Lonesome Dove. Maybe it was because I was born in the panhandle of Texas, my dad was a real cowboy and I could relate better to many of the things mentioned in the book.  As such the others paled in comparison.",4,"I was very sad to have finished a long novel named ""Lonesome Dove"" by Larry McMurtry.

I had to start a job hunt. I also had to start networking with people i have ever met in order to get job leads. A job search will no doubt have its ups and downs (and ups, downs, and ups again). To help you navigate the job hunt and, ultimately, land your first job, you’ll need some direction. Get started by asking yourself these questions:What kind of job do i want,do i have work experience. Do i even know the industries I'm going to. Since i have no where to live i had to go back to my parents,i couldn't afford a apartment or just pay house rent or pay other bills ,i had to depend on my parents. Next morning i started looking for jobs in the internet and making applications,Calling friends. After a few weeks i was offered a job in a manufacturing company. A first job is special. There are a couple of reasons for this: the experience is burned in one’s memory, it gives you the practice needed to fulfill other positions, and it teaches you about the value of money. Of course we do jobs around the house when we are young, like cleaning dishes, vacuuming, and doing laundry, but working for others for money gives off a different feeling. It was a cloth  manufacturing company. After a few weeks of practicing and getting grip on the work, my supervisor decided that I should work solo because she saw confidence in me, and I was confident as well that I could work by myself because I knew exactly what to do. When I started to work solo, I was given more heavy and hard work such as instead of ticketing price tags on shirts and t-shirts, now I had to ticket price tags on heavy jeans, jackets, school-bags, etc. I also had to pack those items in the boxes depending on the price, weight and size of the items. Once, I packed those items in the boxes by using tap-gun, I also had to put those heavy boxes on pallet and move it by using roller to a place where other employees would lift those boxes and put in trucks, which will send it to the stores. Despite being the youngest employee other employees were very friendly. Whenever i need help they were ready to help me out. After three moths i was promoted to higher position and my salary also increased since i was very hardworking and focused. Life was starting to feel better i had to move from my parents house and rent my apartment,i started also paying my bills is not that easy but i had to struggle and do other par time jobs.

We partied like we never had before, and we finally didn’t have to stress about waking on time the next day battling a hangover to get to class. After that, though, the dorms closed.  We all had to leave.   I went back to my family’s house for a while, and the whole world seemed to stop.  As adult as I felt the past few months, I was whisked back to childhood by my parents, controlling my every move once again. I still didn’t have a job, but felt like I was running out of places to apply. My friends from high school mostly weren’t around, either, so days passed so slowly. I have to admit, I enjoyed it at first, finally free of the deadlines, but without the friends and life I’d built in college, all the fun things I wished I could do with my free time just weren’t around to enjoy anymore. This past week has been so hard. I hardly bothered to leave my room much less the house.  But you know what, just when I felt like I needed to resign to this being my life, days of reminiscing for college, I got a call!  Last night, I got an interview for a job at my top choice of firms.  I’m so excited, and it’s really brought my life back into focus. Shopping tomorrow, interview prepping on Wednesday, and if all goes well, my first real job next month!",4,"After four long years of college, my friends and I crossed the finish time.

It was the time of year when the weather starts to change, the time of year when you notice people starting to wear less and less clothes. It's the time of year when all you want to do is go to the beach and enjoy your freedom and youth. The time of year when your cares follow the snow and cold weather; you're not sure where they went but they are not missed. After seeing all this winter snow and being holed up in the house all winter, the need to see the ocean and deep sea fishing became overwhelming. At the time, about 4 months ago, my car was 12 years old and not in the best of shape; hell, my car manufacturer, Saturn, is no longer even in business so how can I trust it to make it from Chicago to south Florida and back! The prudent thing to do would be to take my mom's car. My first problem was that she doesn't want me to use it. I don't see why we can't use it while she is out of town, she won't even know! If I gas it up after I am done with it, she would be none the wiser to my plan. In fact, I would even go so far as to change the oil of her car. It was decided then; we will take my mom's car! My next problem was my puppy. I can't leave a puppy by herself in the house while I am gone. My best option is to take her with us on the trip. There will be several people there and we can take turns watching her. It seems like the perfect plan! The my next problem occured when my mom's car broke down on the way to south Florida. We all piled out of the car and looked at the engine. It took us a long time to get it fixed but ultimately we were able to fix the issue. As we piled back into the car, I noticed our puppy was missing. We left the door open and couldn't find her anywhere in the car. As it was starting to get dark, we went to the car to get a flashlight and when digging it out of the back of the car, who did we find sleeping under the gear, my puppy. So sweet and tired from the trip, she was cuddled up against the warmth of the blanket under the fishing poles and gear; she found the one place in the back that was perfect for her size. Taking both of these signs as an omen, we decided to head back and find a much closer beach; t was an adventure but one that would be best spent closer to home.",2,We went on a trip to south florida for fishing.

We went on trip to South Florida to take advantage of the warm southern whether, since, you know, winter in the north is a pain. We tried to take my van but the blasted thing wouldn't start so that was out. We asked my Dad if we could take his truck but he needed it for work so that was out. We then remembered that my Mom had left her car while she was in Europe for the winter and I called her up. She told us not to take her car but we were out of options so we did anyway. We got about halfway to Florida before the clunker broke down! We were stuck on the side of the road for hours waiting for a tow truck to get there which wasn't fun. Even less fun was thinking we'd lost our puppy! In all the chaos we'd lost track of her and I was so sure she'd gotten out on the highway, but thankfully we were able to find her in the backseat later. She'd burrowed under a blanket and taken a nap, the silly thing! When the tow truck finally got there they towed us home. We were able to fix Mom's car before she got back from her trip so she never knew what had happened. She even commented about how it ran better now than when she'd left!

This is where everything takes a turn. We pull off to the side of the highway in order to check the car. It turns out to be a radiator problem and with no towns for 20 miles in any direction were in trouble. So we are all sitting in the car trying to avoid the heat when we notice ""has anyone see the puppy?"".

We called her name shaked a box of treats and still can't find her. Then my brother in the car calls us all over and low and behold there's the puppy.

He pretends to be a cat, he plays with his cats, he runs around meowing and grooming himself, basically anything a child can do to emulate a cat, he does.  For the last year he has had two cats and always talked about wanting more, always asking if we could get another, pointing out how he would be able to care for another anytime the opportunity arose.  I, as his mom, had said no to any more cats numerous times.  I was dead set against getting anymore, two was enough to feed and care for and buy litter for them to use.  Near my son's seventh birthday his father, my exhusband, called me up and asked if I was interested in a free cat.  My immediate response was no, I was not interested in having another cat in the house.  Then my ex said the cat was going to be a ragdoll, and my immediate no became an enthusiastic yes.  I had previously been interested in getting a rag doll kitty, I knew they were prized for the soft coats and gentle temperaments, and I knew they were sold for thousands of dollars.  Hearing that I could get one for free was amazing and I was not going to miss out on the chance to own a ragdoll.  She came home to us the weekend before his birthday and the humans here loved her immediately.  The other two cats took a little while to warm up to her, but they did.  Now it's commonplace to find them snuggled up to each other sleeping, or darting around playing together like furry little streaks of thunderous kitty running rampage. The cost of caring for three cats is somehow exponentially more than only two, but I wouldn't trade my new kitty for any amount of money in the world.

She was a gift for my seven year old son from his father, he cleared it with me first whether he could get the cat as we already have two.  I initially was going to say no, but then he told me that it was a Rag Doll kitty, and I had read a lot about how awesome that breed of cat is. The fact that it was a pure bred cat changed my mind as to whether we should get it.  My first two cats are rescues, from a kill shelter and from a vet's office, I told myself I had saved two already and I can give this one a good home too. I told him yes, then we had to almost a month for her to be ready to come to our house.  When my ex finally brought her over I had no idea how quickly I would fall in love with her.  She's the cutest, fluffiest, little kitty ever, and her personality is so easy to like.  She's sweet and cuddly, purrs as soon as you touch her or pick her up, and she looks so happy to be pet. She's also super playful, pick up a toy and she comes running and pounces on it, her favorite toys have feathers on them. She runs and jumps through the air so comically that you can't help but laugh at her antics.  She's made a huge impact in my home, the other two kitties have been very accepting of her, after the first day hissings.  I love my first two cats to pieces, but neither one of them is a lap kitty.  New kitty loves to curl up on my lap and be pet.  It makes me so happy to have a kitty that likes to snuggle and be close.

When went after the Sunday service and it was a small group of about 7 people. We drove in two separate cars and the drive was about 10 minutes to get to where we were going. I had some memories come up while we were there from when I was a kid and I used to go swimming with my family and groups of friends at places like these. I also felt myself withdrawing from the group a bit and not relating well. I cut my leg on a rock when I was going into the water. It made me start to obsessively worry about if it would be infected and also being mad at myself for being reckless. The water felt good in the hot weather and I got some good exercise while swimming. I put on a lot of sunscreen so I didn't get sunburned.

It was after a Sunday religious service we are all a part of on a hot summer day. We all arranged together how we would get there and where we were going. We drove in three separate cars. We arrived at an area of a river where there was a canal that had deep and slow moving water. It was a short walk to the area, and we had to climb down a rocky ledge to reach it. I decided to go in fast while the others were tentative because of the cold water. When getting in, I scraped my arm on the rock I was holding while lowering myself. It made me feel rather clumsy and then I started worrying about if it might get infected. I didn't make a big deal of it because I didn't want to ruin anyone else's time. We all swam for a little while, then gathered in a shallow area and just sat and talked for a while. At one point I decided to get up and explore some of the rocky area around the swimming hole. Being with the group was reminding me of times as a kid when I went swimming in these kinds of places with friends. It was making me sad that I don't do it that often anymore. So I felt that going of on my own and gathering my emotions would be best. I walked around on the rocks and looked at the trees of the forest behind it. Then I found a spot in the shade and laid down for the remainder of our time there. A friend yelled up to me that we were leaving so then we all climbed back up the ledge and got in the cars and left.",3,Visiting a swimming hole with a group of friends on a summer day.

Randy, one of my coworkers has been having a really hard time. There had always been rumors that he was a heavy drinker, but I never payed much attention to them. Then he came into work looking destroyed and being extra quiet. I asked him what's up and he just broke down. He said his family had asked him to move out because he had lost control of his drinking. He didn't know what to do. I talked to him a bit and calmed him down, then gave his a number of a rehab clinic that my brother went to. He checked in himself and our boss gave him some time off to get sorted. The rehab program was less than a month and I'm not sure exactly what the program is, but it seemed to help. He came back like a different person. He went back to his wife and apologized and told them he wanted to change. She said she wanted to help him and welcomed him back.

His family left him due to personal issues that they've been having. I was called because his neighbors thought that he had suicidal ideation due to his wife and kids leaving, and was advised that he had weapons in his house. At this time, I was very scared and it took me a moment before I realized what I needed to do. This man needs help immediately and that he can't be alone. So, I called the cops and responded to his home and found out that he wasn't suicidal but was just going through a lot. I asked him if he needs someone to be with him or if he wants to stay the night over in my place. He replied saying he just wants to be alone and that everyone deals with problems differently. He rest assured that he isn't going to hurt himself and that he is just looking forward to tomorrow. I took possession of his weapons to err on the side of caution and he didn't have any issue with it. The next day, he came and spoke to me and said that he has alcohol substance abuse, hence why his family left him. He self referred himself to the clinic. He then had to go inpatient into a rehab facility for 4 weeks. He finished the program 1 week early as he did great and actually came up with his own goals.

The outer banks was quite impressive than expected. I was amazed by the infrastructure of the beach and it was driving us crazy. Apparently,my brothers were planning to take beach diving and I was no barrier to that. I loved the way everyone enjoyed around the beach. The girls with their beach suit were consuming juice and they were about to join the diving. To be honest, the most important thing to be noted was the pleasant and sunny climate which took the enjoyment to the another level. All of a sudden, there formed a dark cloud and it started raining heavily. It made us exclaimed. The thing came to my mind was I should definitely revisit this beach again alongside my friends or family. The resort near the beach was elegant and it made us awestruck with its beautiful outlook. When speaking about the food there, it never disappointed us. The food was delicious there and made it us felt fantastic. Overall, it is a must visit beach along with your family and friends. There is a theme park located near the beach and it was way far better than other theme parks in the country. The rides are very enjoyable there.

We'd invited my in-laws to join us an extra set of eyes to help keep an eye on the girls while we went to the beach (you never know when one of them is going to want to run off and we didn't want anyone alone in or near the water). Not only was this our first family vacation as a family of four, but it was to the beach. The girls had never been to the beach before. We went to The Outer Banks, or OBX as the locals and annual visitors call it. We were so excited to see the expression on our 1 yr old and 2 yr old faces; would it be joy or even possibly fear that they'd express . Shockingly the girls aren't as much of a fan of the beach as their mother is. The response of our 2 yr old as she first stepped into the sand "" ew, yuck so dirty!"" was a laugh for all of us but it should have also been a sign as to how they would like or dislike the beach. What kid doesn't enjoy getting a little dirty or at least one would normally think. But not our girls. We didn't last more than 30 minutes building sand castles and standing on the sand as the waves washed over our feet. They'd talk about going to the beach but as soon as we'd get there, they'd be bored or tired of walking on the sand. Although the beach itself didn't go over as well as we'd anticipated, at least the girls enjoyed getting away and ""seeing"" the beach from a distance. And at least we got pictures we can look back at...however short the time was. And the memories....oh the memories we created were priceless.

One day when I went to the hospital to visit my mother, she was clearly very disoriented. She appeared to have no recognition of my presence and appeared to see something off to her right. She seemed alarmed and frightened. As her health declined, she showed a decline in memory and some personality changes from day to day, however this was the most disconnected I had ever seen her and the seeming fear was new. I could deal with her feisty attitudes, however seeing mom terrified was terribly upsetting.    I went to the nurses' station and they indicated that they would have the doctor come to her room. The doctor, upon her arrival, explained that my mother had experienced difficulty in falling asleep the night before, so they had given her a new medicine. She successfully slept all night and all day, but had awoken not long before my arrival. It seems that hallucinations were a side effect of the medicine. The doctor assured me that they would not give her that medicine again.    One reason that the moment stands out in my recent memory is that I tend to be very stoic. I seldom show emotion in public. I was so distressed over my mother's condition that I could not stop sobbing in front of the doctor. I was embarrassed by my lack of control, but was overwhelmed by seeing my mother appearing to suffer. My mother has since passed away. That was probably the most difficult visit that I paid her during the end of her life.",3,I came to visit my mother in the hospital during a prolonged and terminal illness.

In the past six weeks, her health has gone in steep decline. She is elderly and had been diagnosed with a terminal illness, but had been coasting along for a couple of years without much deterioration. About six weeks ago, we took her to the ER with what we thought was a mild issue. It was not mild. Her illness went a sudden and steep decline. When I went to visit my mother this week, I heard her yelling before I entered her hospital room. She did not focus on me when I entered the room and she looked terrified. She kept repeating the same nonsense phrase over and over again. Of course, I wanted to do something to comfort her. She seemed fairly unreachable. I finally went to ask for her nurse to come so that we could see if there was a medical intervention that might comfort her. My mother's doctor came to the room and explained that she had been unsettled the previous evening, so she was given a medication. As a result of the medication, she slept last night, all day today, and had recently woke with hallucinations. I am generally a stoic person, but while the doctor was talking, I began crying. I could not seem to stop. I cried during my entire drive home. I thought that I had become desensitized to my mother's health decline, but I found at that moment that I could not handle her clearly suffering.  The hospital is steering clear of the medicine that gave her the hallucinations, so I will hopefully not see my mother looking that terrified again.",3,I came to visit my mother in the hospital during a prolonged and terminal illness.

It was an open-handed, angry slap on the face. Followed by frozen shared-shock. It all started when we were arguing over who should be doing what tasks around the apartment. I was living with her for a few months until I could get on my feet, because I was new to the city. And at a distance, with enough time between interactions- the bossy, assured nature she would dictate our time together in, was almost a comfort. I really liked having her be that for us, and I think she really enjoyed having me being compliant and helpful. But when a few times a month became everyday, the tension began to build. Perhaps I would offer to take the dogs out a few days she was busy getting ready in the morning. Then the next week she would ask me every day to take her dogs out and to also feed them. When the clothes sitting in the washer were blocking me from doing my laundry, I would go ahead and finish out her loads of laundry. Then the next week she would ask me to do her laundry for her. It would even be things that weren't house care related. If she didn't want to be alone doing something, she would ask me to accompany her to do it-perhaps watching her hang up her clothes, or sit with her while she studied. Well one particular night it came to a head when she asked me to come help her clean up the kitchen. I had not dirtied up the kitchen, and I didn't want to clean it up. And when she would ask for help doing something-you can bet that meant I was just going to do most if not all of it, and she absolutely used that to her advantage. But this night, I said no. She was so taken aback by this that she got angry with me. I was so offended that she would get mad that I declined to help on this ONE thing that it escalated quickly over the next 40 minutes. We started kitchen-sinking, mudslinging, slandering, defaming each other just specifically calling out every minuscule problem we had with each other over the past month. Until eventually we got up in each other's faces and she slapped me across the face. It's been about 4 months since then, and we still haven't spoken. I just hope that one day we can get past this, because it breaks my heart that such a stupid beginning of a fight has ended in more serious sadness.",4,My best friend in the world and I got into a fight about cleaning the apartment where we both lived.

I had to pack up the entire house alone, and ended up selling some items, as there was no more space on the truck.  I was so worried about the overage charges that I have heard those movers charge when you have mores things then you are supposed to.  My cat is older, and I didn't want to stress him with the relocation, so I had to let him stay with my family back in Denver.  That was one of the hardest parts of this move.  Then when I got to my girlfriends place, she has a cat.  And it hates me, almost as much as I dislike him.  I followed the truck over 12 hours, driving throughout the night.  I was so tired.

We had been talking for quite some time and we've been friends for about 4 years. We both felt like we were incredibly committed to each other and wanted to take a chance on being with each other. I remember it being very hard to get everything in order for me to move. I had to find money in between the bills and responsibilities I had in order to be able to fund moving. I had lots of things that I needed to mail and I also had to get money for plane tickets. I think it was really stressful even finding bookings as the holiday season was not too far around the corner and DIA is already an exceptionally busy airport. I remember being worried to let my roommate know that I would be moving as we both worked together and were pretty much best friends. I knew they would be upset about it, as they tend to get upset about things before eventually coming to understanding that things are going to be the way they are. Once I had finally gotten most of the finances I needed to, I eventually told my roommate my plans and reasons to move. It was very exciting but I was also getting more and more anxious the closer the date of my flight came. On that day I had all my things packed up, ready to mail and my luggage for my flight ready. I called an Uber to take me to the UPS store so I could mail the packages I wouldn't be taking on the flight. Then I took a second Uber downtown to the train station. I would then take a train to the airport. I arrived about 3-4 hours early so that I'd have time to get past TSA and grab some food and try my best to relax. I'm terrified of flying so I was really nervous. Our flight got delayed by about an hour because the weather was really bad. We finally got on the plane and I immediately ordered drinks from the flight attendant when she came by. I needed something to relax me. I finally landed in Houston around midnight that night.

This consisted of me and a few fellow coworkers. Our job was to run and make sure a large recruiting event goes smoothly as planned. We had access to about 5 large event rooms in a hotel. All filled with a total of 300 potential recruits/clients. This was a very big deal, and many upper level directors/executives were there to show face and talk and stuff. However, all of a sudden there was an issue with connection, keep in mind every recruit had our technology and were testing/using them. Nothing was logging in, no programs were launching, etc. This would be a game ender if not figured out right then and there. So I was able to re-route the entire back-end connections and almost luckily did the right thing and saved that entire project and live presentations from complete failure. That's what got me noticed and praised. It was funny but also a very awesome moment. It's because of this event that I was able to jump up very quickly in the company.

My second wedding to my most wonderful husband ever.. our 10th anniversary.  Maybe people think I should have waited another 10 years but there are key people in my life I wanted to witness us renew our vows and as morbid it may sound, possibly will not be with us another ten years. Added addition to the ceremony is  our lovely 6 year old daughter who were our flower girl. I bought a simple, yet pretty gown and my husband got a tailored made suit. Our daughter got the prettiest dress ever and we set the date over the winter on the beach in our local city, Miami.  The ceremony was beautiful and my husband and I expressed our love to each other and the blessing,m our daughter we have created. We had a small gathering following the ceremony in our backyard where our guests can mingle. Everyone goes to our home and good food, music, and drinks is  served. The open bar was a hit, maybe too much of it as few of the guests, including my husband got sloppy drunk. While others danced with drunk(ness) on the dance floor, including my husband, one, my ""lovely"" uncle step it up a notch and started to flirt with other women, while aunt is present and gotten rowdy. I was somewhat embarrassed and my aunt came to me to say she will handle it and taken my inebriated uncle outside to calm down. Luckily all this transpired shortly after my daughter went inside the house  with a older cousin whom we asked to babysit my daughter. Aside from my husband who could not remember half of the night and my crazy uncle who had to sleep away his liquor, overall the wedding was beautiful and everyone enjoyed themselves. I got another chance to celebrate my 10th wedding anniversary and once again fall in love with husband. That night also serves a reminder why I am once pregnant again months later.",1,"We got married with our children and my grandparents present.

My son Ryan is a very active and curious little boy.  We were married in a gazebo at a park.  The park was filled beautiful gardens and a lake with a water feature in the middle.  Our wedding day was on a beautiful summer day.  During the ceremony the local ducks decided to join us.  The ducks made a mess on the floor of the gazebo.  As we were saying our vows, Ryan noticed the ducks and decided to check them out.  He dashed to the area of the gazebo, where the ducks were.  As he ran toward them, he slipped and fell in the duck's poop and tripped over my grandmother's feet, soiling her shoes.  By that time the ducks decided to leave and they waddled towards the lake.  When Ryan got up from tripping over my grandmother's feet, he chased after the ducks.  By this time we saw Ryan chasing the ducks and going towards the lake.  George and I stopped saying our vows to each other and chased after Ryan.  But, it was too late to catch him before he got to the lake.  To our dismay, Ryan fell in the lake.  Thank goodness the water was not deep at the edge and we were able to get to him safely.  After all the drama, we went back to the Gazabo and continued saying our vows.

I had just attended a lecture at the time, and I found the content extremely emotionally draining, so I wasn't in an excellent mood to begin with. The location where my tire blew out was congested with heavy rush hour traffic; my car broke down next to a sidewalk that was labeled ""no stopping any time."" Many cars honked at me despite my obvious predicament. A woman in a giant black Mercedes halted everyone behind her to shout at me from her window; she had a thick Kardashian accent and a Starbucks cup in her hand as she called, ""The sign says NO STOPPING ANY TIME."" I rushed to replace the tire, but I am a very small, not particularly strong person, so it was a slow going process. An older man in ragged clothes who smelled heavily of dirt and sweat approached me. My stomach dropped with dread. While I am generally not a cruel person and welcome interactions with people in unfortunate situations, being stuck as I was in ninety degree heat with drivers around me shouting angrily and honking, I wasn't in the most convenient position to help anyone. I didn't have any cash with me to give him, and I didn't know if I could handle a heart-wrenching conversation about how horrendous life can be or learning about the man's visions from God, if he had them. It wasn't kind of me, and in retrospect I am not proud of my feelings when he first approached. My anxieties were unfounded, and unfair. The man said nothing to me. He bent down beside my ruined tire, and began removing it from the car.  I have never been so moved by anything in my life. A person who I had unfairly feared, a man who was so much less fortunate than every luxury-vehicle driving heckler that drove by, was the only person who stopped to help me change my tire. There were tears in my eyes when I thanked him. We talked for a little while; he'd been a teacher once. He didn't go into specifics about his current situation. I offered to take him to dinner, but he refused. He told me to drive safely, and then he walked away. I'm convinced this man was some kind of guardian angel. I'm so grateful to him.",2,"A homeless man stopped to help me change my tire when I had a tire blow out in the middle of a busy, affluent Southern California street.

I haven't written here in a while because I've been preoccupied with my illness, but it seems like it's completely gone!  And it's all thanks to cheese! About 2 months ago I was suffering from chronic migraines.  I had one almost every day.  Then I read about a certain kind of fungus in a special kind of cheese that was reported to have medicinal effects.  This fungus supposedly could reduce--even eliminate--the occurrence of migraine headaches.  Luckily I love cheese.  And the only place that carried this strange cheese was Costco.  So I got a trial membership and bought pounds of the stuff.  I ate some everyday.  Actually, a lot.  Because it was delicious.  It seemed to work almost immediately.  The first week of eating the cheese daily I had only 2 short migraines.  The second through fourth week, one a week.  The fifth to eighth week I had only 2 migraines.  Now it's the ninth week and I haven't had one yet.

They say food is the best medicine, and I found, perhaps serendpitiously, a product at Costco that provided great relief from this medical condition, which can now be classified as parasitic infection according to my recent blood work results. It happened roughly 2 months ago, but I will describe in detail what the product is and why it helps my condition. Looking at it from a broader perspective, this event was magnificent and a relief, as it offers tremendous hope for the future, and for others that may have similar woes. Whilst browsing for cheeses in the cheese isle at costco, there was a particular brand that stood out to me. It said, ""New York Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese"" on the package label. What is so special about New York extra sharp cheddar cheese, I thought. I've tried so many cheddar cheese brands before, but with little to no benefit. It turns out that this particular one uses annatto as a food coloring. In general food coloring is regarded as detrimental to one's health, but annatto is unique. It doubles both as a spice and a food coloring agent. The spice is mild and not usually detectable by our bodies. After eating this cheese, something special happened. The parasites that have been plaguing me for decades started imploding and there was a mass exodus that I do not wish to describe in detail, but it involved running to the bathroom 30-40 times in the span of 5 hours. But why? Why did this agent work when so many other expensive medical treatments and anti-parasitic medicines have failed in the past? In this case, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. All the individual components of the cheese are important. Annatto is an anti-parasitic agent according to the medical literature. It offers numerous benefits in terms of health and is a relatively common spice used in cooking. Combined with the minuscule amount of milk sugar in the cheese, often referred to as whey, the overall effect is synergistic.",4,"I discovered a product at costco that offered tremendous hope for my medical issue.

One thing led to another, and we became quite close.  We've been dating since we have returned from that seminar, and even reported the relationship to HR.  He wants me to meet his family.  This would be all well and good, but I'm terrified what they must think of me.  I'm nearly 40, which makes me almost old enough to be his mother.  I hate that age is such a factor, but I can't help but feel the stares every time we go out.  So, I'm nervous to meet his family.  I haven't even told my own family that I'm seeing someone.

Sis and I have plenty of fond memories of our birthdays growing up over the years, but now that we're older we realized that it had always been about us; we didn't have any memories in particular about celebrating our mom's birthdays by doing anything special. We had a hard time even remembering how old she was! Can you imagine that? We took it upon ourselves to make her know that we did appreciate her this time around. We went out and got ingredients, inspired and determined to make a cake for her with our own hands. We don't bake much, but we found a recipe that looked pretty good and got started on it. I'm not going to say it was the hardest thing in the world, but the labor was satisfying in a way. It made is reflect on the effort that mom must have put in for our birthdays, as we've always had homemade cake. In the end, we managed to bring it together. It wasn't a surprise party or anything like that. We told her that we wanted to celebrate with her at home and have a little party to ourselves. She sounded happy on the phone, but I didn't realize just what it would mean to her. The party was simple; just the 3 of us. We had each gotten her little gifts; knick nacks. I got her a new light for her bike (her last one had been stolen) and sis got her a new scarf. We opened the presents first and enjoyed the day a little bit before we brought in our homemade cake to surprise her. You should have seen the light shining in her eyes! They were glistening with the sun as tears began to well up. ""I've never had a cake before!"" she said. Talked about how she hadn't even stopped to think about her birthdays while we were growing up. She was always working hard doing her best to make us feel safe and taken care of.

It was so... so.. good! We met with an old friend before heading to our next destination which was New York. We went to The Statue of Liberty, Times Square and China Town. We bought the red bus ticket so we can hop on and hop off easily. The boys certainly didn't want to drive there because the road was a mess and so crazy. We spent most of our time on the bus and listened to the history of New York. It was sad to go home but we had a lot of fun. We got home safely despite of a little incident of our old minivan. Suddenly the steering wheel was becoming heavy and made a squeaking noise. The noise became louder when we were almost home but we made it safely.  I guess even the car got tired.

Also all the ingredients were easy to obtain. I immediately saved the page and made the list. I proceeded to go to the store for the items. The ingredient list was simple and short. I was more shocked that the total cost was less than expected. I carefully followed the instructions and made a batch. I was surprised at how well it turned out. It ended up being better than expected. It was great to get the desired effects at a savings. I highly recommend this for anyone who vapes.

First of all, you have to get your ingredients together. Typically vape e liquid consists of vegetable glycerin, propylene glycol, nicotine and, flavoring. So, i easily buy my propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG) from amazon for almost dirt cheap. These two bottles will cost you about 15 dollars. Then, you will have to buy some nicotine and flavoring from a seperate website for about 10 dollars each. With these four bottles you are pretty much set for the whole year to make as much juice as you want. And this is why there are so many vape shops popping up sound your city. It's because anyone can slap a label on to a bottle and call it their own. Theres hundreds of thousands of different brands out there and a ton of flavors. Also, you can find the recipes for your favorite blend/brand online and make a clone version of your favorite juice. So, i've been doing this for a about a year or so now and it has saved me so much money. I used to buy 20 dollar bottles every other day. But now i make my own. I don't see why i haven't thought of this earlier. I should have put two and two together when i ""vaping"" started to be a popular way to quit cigarettes. Then all the vape stores popped up- putting their own labels on a bottle that will cost you around 1 dollar to make yet they will charge you 20 dollars in their store. it's ridiculous.",1,I came up with the realization that i can save money by making my own nicotine e-liquid versus buying it at the store.

I usually buy my e-juice from the vape store but, i found out recently that you can make it yourself. It is rather cheap compared to buying a 20 dollar bottle in the store. It costs me about one to two dollars to make a 30ml bottle of vape liquid. I also find it pretty healthier compared to smoking cigarettes as, i know what i'm vaping. It's only four ingredients (PF, VG, nicotine, and concentrated flavor) compared to whatever is inside cigarettes. Not only does mixing up a batch of this stuff save me time and money, i enjoy doing it. I was just so surprised that i haven't heard of other people doing the DIY ejuice making. So, this was a striking realization.  It's fun to browse all the flavors that you can mix/make. Now i know why there are so many vape shops opening everywhere, it's because people are buying these 20 dollar bottles and it's highly profitable to the owners but, little do the the customers know it's just a simple blend of 4 ingredients. Propylene Glycol, Vegetable Glycol, Nicotine, and Artificial flavoring. Now i don't know about you but, i think that sounds much more healthier in comparison to standard cigarettes.

For the longest time, all I cared about was work. Even when I was at home, I thought about work and money. I don't know where I got it from, because my mom and dad weren't workaholics, nor were my grandparents. My grandpa has actually talked to me about how I need to cool it with the work 'addiction'. I've always been close with him. I grew up with him and saw him at least a few times a month. Four months ago, he had a heart attack and died. I hadn't seen him for almost a month prior to this, so I felt extremely sad and guilty. He was a very happy man and put family over everything. His death made me realize that it is important to live like he did, not obsess over work like I did. I need to enjoy life, take his advice and stop working so much. Since he died four months ago, I have spent more time with family that I have in the past 3 years.

He had been ill with dementia and physically deteriorating for a while but I still wasn't prepared to lose him. He was mentally declining and most of the time he would just sit in his chair and go in and out of a mental fugue state. The last time I saw him was six days before he died. He was already in hospice care and depressed. I showed him a picture of my newborn son and we talked about baseball. It was his favorite sport and he loved to watch the Detroit Tigers. He was very lucid and aware. He talked to me about how much he still missed Verlander since the trade and that he hoped the Tigers would have a good year despite losing so many players. He then told me that my baby looked like my wife. It was a very emotional day. His death really taught me to appreciate every moment of every day. I had spent so much of my time rushing through life that I never bothered to consider that it will eventually end. There will be some people who will really miss me after I am gone. I inherited money from his estate and invested the bulk of it. One of my most fond, recurring, memories from when I was a child was going to my grandparents lake cottage and spending weekends and vacations there. To honor my grandfather and provide my own children that kind of experience I purchased a cottage this summer, on a lake about an hour and a half drive away. On weekends we all go up there and relax. My daughter loves the beach and just sitting out in the shady yard. My little one is scooting around the place pretty good and likes to go sit under an umbrella and play in the sand. Every time I am there I think about my grandfather and wish so very, very much that he could be there to enjoy this with us. At times it feels like he is there. I firmly intend to instill all the values that I learned from him over the years. He was a good man, a simple man, and he was always looking for the sun after the rain.",4,"Upon my grandfather's death I realized that there is a lot more to life than just working my way through it.

The event was outdoors, on the streets, with no respite from the sun. This made it challenging for vendors to keep their cheeses cold and stocked. The event drew a bigger crowd than they had imagined. Many vendors started selling out of their most popular items within the first few hours.

I have known a child that was abused in a different manner, and that is the only way I can identify with this story. Personally, however, I do not identify with it much, if at all.","When I was eight years old, about 22 months ago, my dad started to hit me. The most memorable part of this is the way he acted after the abuse each time. He would apologize like he had done something minor, like forgetting to read me a bedtime story. He just acted like what happened was something that he could apologize and move on from. I will never forget the way he dismissed his own behavior. However, his behavior ended up ruining mine and my siblings' lives. I fear that if I ever see him again or that if he has more children in the future, the abuse will continue once more. I hope that he does not remarry a woman that has children of her own as well. I fear that if he becomes involved with a wife or other children, he will abuse them as well. The abuse has been significant to my life because it has led to a chain of events that have landed me in foster care. After a teacher noticed the bruises, she told officials. Officials investigated the situation of my home life and immediately determined that I was not safe at home with my father. Since my mother is not in the picture, I was placed immediately into foster care. This did not only affect me, however. My siblings were abused and place into foster care as well. We were placed with different foster families and I have not seen my sibling since. I miss my siblings, and as much as my home was an unhappy place, I miss having a home to call my own. I feel that I have no one in the world that truly knows me or that I can depend on. I just feel very alone. It is hard for me to talk about anyone about this since it is a very personal experience that only a few other that have been through it can understand. It helps a little bit to write out my feelings in this diary, but it is not the same as talking to a trusted person that understands how I feel.

I listen to songs which make me cry and I love to indulge into the emotions of the song. Does that mean I love crying? Absolutely I do. Because sometimes I need tears more than the flattering lips. The smile is being so overrated and people have become obsessed for getting this ingredient on their plate. The energy put in suppressing the emotions bounce back with the equal reaction.

It takes place during the time in which I live in Hawaii. I was homeless for 9 years in Hawaii because of the president during that time was trying to extort money from military families to fund his campaign about going to war against another country. I remember when I was 8 years old, seeing the Sheriff at our front door saying that we were going to be escorted out of our government house due to the fact that we were unable to make $3000. 00 within the week to give them. At the time I didn't know what this meant because I was so young. After we began to move out of our house, Reality began to make sense and the danger of the unknown future was beginning to weigh down upon the center of my consciousness. I grew up homeless, loosing everything that I ever owned over a weekend changed the way that I think and see things. I grew up in homeless shelters, living in the back of a car with my brother, sister, and mother who was at the time very frustrated with the way things were going, I didn't blame her. My mom never made good decisions afterwards. She picked the wrong people to trust and those people always took advantage of us. Those who were supposed to be apart of the Christian society are the most wicked people I have ever lived with. Taking the little money we had and abusing my mom in front of me makes me want to hunt them down and treat them in a similar way. I will not forgive them, nor forget them. Years have passed now, My mom is dead. She died on the Fourth of July. She endured all of that abuse just to die a few years later. I am alone now. I have no real family left. I am attending Job Corps which I am now hearing are being shut down throughout the country by another man that says he does it for the ""Good of the Country"". I have no bad feelings towards the present president, but I hope that he doesn't make another decision like the past president that will affect so many in the most unfortunate ways. They say America is the greatest country, I don't see that any more.

If I could go back in time I think I would find him before he got the dementia and spend as much time with him as possible. He would still get the disease but at least this time I would know not to leave him high and dry on bad terms like I did before. I guess it's moments like this that really make you think.

The most memorable event was the last time I saw him, we drove off in the van and he was just sitting in his wheelchair in the driveway, glaring at us. He was happy that we were leaving because he thought we were overreacting about what he had done and said. He started to get REALLY mean to my 2.5 year old son and would say terrible things to him when he wouldn't listen. I'll never forget his facec as we drove off. I think about it all the time. I wish I could tell him that I'm sorry and that I love him. I was so shocked when I got the phone call. We visit his grave in Redmond all the time, but now it's almost winter so we will have to wait a bit. He meant so much to my son, now Malakai says ""Grandpa is in the stars!"". It breaks my heart.

You only eat when you are allotted food, which is about twice a week in meager portions. Bathing, cleaning, grooming are all strictly prohibited. Any contact with family or attempts to break free are temptations that the lord does not look kindly on. Jane went over to lucys house and said she had lost significant weight, looked unkempt, and the house was a mess. She was informed by garret that Lucy couldnt speak to family on grounds of initiation. She called the police bu they informed her that they cannot do anything as she is doing this of her own free will. I never knew such cults existed and don't know what to do now.

It's been a long time since I've seen her so sad. She had recently finished speaking to Aunt Rue in New Jersey on the phone when I noticed how low her mood was. When I asked, she told me she had just learned really disturbing news. According to Aunt Rue, my cousin Deena -- who is my mother's and aunt's niece -- has apparently joined what other family members described as a ""cult."" We don't live in the same state and visit close to never, so it's not surprising that all of us up East were a bit suspicious of the claims. We thought the family Down South was exaggerating the situation... that is, until we went down to see for ourselves. Shockingly, we soon learned, they were not stretching the truth in the least. Deena, always a husky if not somewhat fat person, had lost so much weight we could barely recognize her. Her house, always pristine and inviting, was now a veritable dump with stuff just thrown haphazardly everywhere. The saddest part was that she seemed oblivious to how all of this looked to other people. Months later we still have not figured out how to get through to Deena.  She has resisted every attempt to break through her wall and help her understand how dangerous and unhealthy her predicament is. The family Down South continues to monitor her as closely as possible while attempting to not appear like they are stalking her, which makes her defensive, angry and argumentative. Meanwhile, the rest of us are seeking professional advice because it has become increasingly certain that we cannot get through to her on our own.

It seems that cousin Deena is now a full-fledged member of an actual cult. I NEVER would have seen this coming when I was just an innocent kid who used to go Down South each summer and stay with her over other nearby relatives because she was so kind to me. Although it's been decades, I remember her taking me to the movies (thanks for introducing me to Burt Reynolds and making ""Smokey and the Bandit"" one of my all-time nostalgia faves), amusement parks (NOTE: avoid falling down in a pit of animal poo when at the zoo) and our annual family reunion barbecue. This was before her child was born, so it was just me and her for the most part when we weren't out and about. Those were the days -- miss 'em indeed. Now her child is grown and she looks like an anorexic, bug-eyed, stressed-out version of her old dour, well-fed self. She has literally lost dozens of pounds and is so skinny, the entire family is afraid severe weight loss will end her before any other medical problem can. I first found out about the cult she joined from relatives who, unlike me, talk to her fairly regularly. We went to see her in person this summer because of increasing concerns about her state of mind, and were we in for a shock. Her formerly well-kept home, which she has owned for years, was a complete mess, like a hurricane flew through it several times over. SHE was a complete mess, too. It was so sad to see her but not recognize the random ramblings about her new group of ""friends."" Unfortunately, we did not get to meet any of them, so there were no confrontations with the people dragging her down. Our only hope is that eventually we will be able to stage a successful intervention to help her reclaim her life.

But we do get together with friends because we like them so much. Our friends are avid campers and invited us to go with them over the weekend in the middle of summer. Of course we accepted and we looked at each other when we got home and wondered what supplies we might need. We had no idea what to bring nor what to expect. So we did the best we could considering we didn't even have sleeping bags much less a tent. We arrived at the campsite where our friends were already. The place was serene and had a good atmosphere but the heat was unbearablly hot. There was no place to hide from the heat. We didn't move much during the day at all and hoping that the sun would go down quicker than usual. We took short hikes around the campground just to see what type of facilities were there. Not much in the form of relief from the heat. Well the sun finally went down and then we had to deal with the mosquitoes. I hate mosquitoes. Fortunately we did bring insect repellant and our friends saw that we were a bit frustrated about the whole thing. Our friends started a bonfire and that was wonderful. That took away the mosquitoes and was warming the coolness of the night. We drank beer and told stories of our past and then had a good time from that point on. I am glad it lasted only two days because I just am not cut out to be a big time camper like my friends. Me and my wife were surprised at the empathy that our friends took on us. I felt that they had been in the same position when they first started out camping as well. Me and my wife learned a lot about ourselves and our friends during that lost weekend of our lives.

I started by searching the internet for anything I could find. I was surprised at how much you could learn and how complex it could be but I didn't let it scare me; I continued in my quest to learn more. I was intrigued by just how many wild foods there were out there available for us to eat. It made me realize that people aren't using the natural resources we have and that there are a lot of things that are going to waste just because we don't know it's available to us. After a week of doing extensive research, I decided to go on a hunt and see exactly what I could find. I drove about an hour away to a location that was plentiful of forest and wildlife that I thought would suit me for my foraging needs. As I walked through the woods, I stumbled upon things I had not recognized from my research, so I had to use my best judgement about whether or not this was something that could be edible. I found a patch of wild berries that looked good so I decided to try my luck and eat one. They were very sweet and did not have a bitter taste, so I ate a few more before continuing on my way. Further on my travels, I saw some wild plants so I decided to pick them and take them home with me to see what I could do with them. This was turning out to be quite the interesting adventure. I heard a rustling noise behind me so I abruptly looked over my shoulder and realized that I had entered someone else's territory. Instead of seeing a person like I expected, I saw a beautiful deer standing behind me. It didn't run away like I thought, but just looked at me inquisitively, stopped to take in the sights and smells of nature, and then slowly walked away. At that moment, I thought to myself, people and animals aren't all that different. We are all here for the same reason; survival and to try and protect what is ours. As it started getting dark, I figured it was time to pack up and take my findings home. My stomach was feeling a little bit queasy and I was hoping it wasn't the berries I ate from earlier!",2,"I learned about food foraging from self-study, reading and videos.

Foraging for food in the landscape around me is a real thing and I can do it. I started thinking about the plants around me when I saw a foraging video on YouTube. A teacher was showing students about all of the edible plants in a park that happens to be near my house. I was interested in the video as I have alot of experience with gardening and it dawned upon me that I could do this too. I started looking up plants online and watching other videos about plant identification. I started slowly by looking for one single type of plant and trying to identify it multiple times. After I was confident that I could identify the plant, I ate a couple of leaves just to test out the effects of it. I would wait a day and when nothing happened negative, I became more confident in my id's. I ate more the next time and continued to find out as much as I could about the plants habitat and features. Immersing myself in one plant at a time has been a great way to expand my knowledge. Now I can identify many plants in my area. I know the leaves, fruits, colors and features of a number of edible plants. This has given me a food source other than buying food from the grocery. It's amazing to see something all around you that was always there but you never saw before.

It really opened my eyes and showed me something new. I did a bunch of reading and research which prepared me to go into the parks around me and find things. There is lots of food in the local parks in big cities. There is even stuff growing in the sidewalk planters. Things we call ""weeds"" are actually nutritious and delicious plants.

To recover these costs I have decided to sue my landlady. There was no reason for her to go to that extreme and I am certain I will recover the costs.

She's really a property manager, not the owner/landlady so I got to serve the owner of the property.  Since he is out-of-state I am betting he won't show up and I will get a default judgment.  Small Claims Court is nice because he can't send a lawyer or another representative in to appear for him.  I am looking forward to resolving this matter to recover my money and to be validated.

It hovered in the air for about thirty seconds before jetting off over the horizon at speeds that don't seem possible. The wind died back down as the UFO left our sight. We all just stood in disbelieve at what we witnessed. We uploaded the video to social media and my friend managed to stream a bit of the ship live on Instagram.

We had spent about five hours in the late afternoon looking before it got dark and we decided to head home. We were driving thru a town next to the park called 29 Palms that has a marine base in it when we saw a UFO from the car! It was a long bright light in the sky that was out in the desert. We pulled over and started to film the object and talk about what it was. It didn't seem to move much in the air and didn't seem far away. My Girlfriend was driving and figured we might be able to get closer to it (we were about a mile away) so we drove down some streets to get to it. We were able to drive right up too it and film it for about 25 minutes. The light looked like a long glowing ribbon in the sky that made no noise. It was very windy but was able to control itself against the wind and would lift up into the sky a few hundred feet and come back down less then one hundred feet about our heads. Many other people started to stop and see the UFO. After close to 30 minutes since we originally saw the object it started to move away from up and against the wind making us get back in our cars and drive another street over to it. As we pulled up we saw the item come down to the ground and turn off. Myself, my Friend and 9 other people that stopped to see the UFO all ran out of our cars and into the desert to look for it, but we couldn't find it at all. We couldn't figure out where it went or what it was. The most likely explanation was it was a light up tail of a kite or a rope on a drone but it made no noise so drone is out, if it's a kite where was the guy holding it? They had to have seen all these people stopped on the side of the road looking and running into the desert to find it. There are some powerlines that cross between where we stood under the object and where it came down so that's not safe and how did it not get stuck? I have tried looking for the object online but can't find anyone selling anything similar to it and the videos online do not look like my video or the object we saw. On the drive home I uploaded the video I took of the UFO, now most of my videos are of animals so this one was a little out of place but by morning had thousands of people emailing, messaging,  commenting on the video asking questions trying to figure it out. A number of large UFO and paranormal Youtubers reached out to me to use the footage on their shows and podcasts!

This is something that we've never thought of doing before. However we both wanted to get things back on the right vibes. To make things sexy between us again. So we thought going to a swingers resort could help us out with that. My wife and I spend 10 days at a swingers resort and it was great. we did a lot of adult things like going to strip clubs and meeting other swingers couples. we were able to build connections with people we would have never met if we didn't decide to go. People that we could probably ask for advice or just have someone to talk to at times that could relate to us. Overall it was a wonderful 10 days. Meeting a large number of interesting and sexy people. If you are someone looking to get out and experience more of the adult things in life. We would highly recommend this adventure.,1,"My wife and I spend 10 days at a swingers resort. We have a wonderful time and meet a large number of interesting, sexy people.

His name was Mr. Bolton. Although he looked quite young, he claims he has been teaching math for 15 years. I have always been very good at math, so I was looking forward to learning a lot in this class. Of course the first few weeks easy because most of the material was review. However, Mr. Bolton insisted that everything been done exactly as he wanted it. For example, we had to right our name in the upper right hand corner of each assignment. If it was not written there he would take of points. In about the middle of October, when we started getting into the new material, things took a turn for the worse. Mr. Bolton insisted that the students were required to show the work for how we solved the problems. He would not except the fact that this is old fashioned way of doing things. Students today are have lived their entire lives in the digital age. When there is something to know, we use our cells phones to search for the answer. That's how we did the work, it can't be written down. If the answer is correct, that all you need. Well, Mr. Bolton kept taking off points for not showing the work, and by Thanksgiving, my average in the class was 47! Since I have always been an honor student, I know the problem was Mr. Bolton, not me. So I told Mom about it. She called the Principal, and got me transferred to another class.",1,This entry is about an experience i had recently in school.

But what really made me mad was the note that Sarah slipped into my locker during passing period. She said she was sad that I’ve been hanging out with Jane more lately and thinks that I don’t want to be her friend anymore. I can’t believe she thinks that, especially after talking with her on the phone for hours and hours last month while she was going through her breakup with Nick!

I hope she gets over it!!!Sorry I didn’t get to write last night! It was such a busy day, and I was too tired to write anything...I was right about Sarah not being okay. Yesterday, she barely spoke to me, and anything she did say was a “yes” or “no” answer.  I tried so hard to get her to cheer up, but of course she just kept saying, “I’m fine, I’m fine.” Uggh! I wish she would just be honest with me! I’m always honest with her! It’s not fair!Jane also seemed mad all day because she could tell that Sarah was being fake nice to her. I hate being in the middle of all of this. What am I supposed to do? Sarah’s been my friend since forever, and Jane is my new friend, and I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings!

It is fiction.,"Dear Diary,It's been eight weeks, but I think I'm finally able to put down on paper what happened to my husband and me when we went to see Niagra Falls.  I've already told you about all the fun we had, how amazing the Falls themselves were, but I haven't told you about my own personal fall.  I guess I've been looking over my shoulder, still nervous that they might change their mind and come after me and lock me up.  It's just not like me to get in trouble with the law. The Falls were good, the shopping was good, but something happened when we went out to eat that first night.  Maybe it was the excitement of seeing the Falls, the rush of all that water, the exciting splash of water on my arms, making the hair stand on end.  The gentle kiss of the wet breeze on my face.  We decided to spend a little more than usual on dinner and go someplace fancy. It wasn't just fancy, it was elegant, refined.  It was the most romantic dinner we'd been to since our honeymoon.  We started with a glass of champaign, split a bottle of red wine during the meal, and then got lured by the waiter into trying something afterwards, a nice Canadian port he recommended. It was amazing.  Like velvet on our tongues.  I've never been really, really drunk before like that.  We stumbled back to our room and had an amazing night.  Something really came alive in my husband, and in me.  It was my first time with a hangover, but it was a night of many firsts, for both of us. We loaded up with several bottles of that port before heading home again.  I'm always nervous crossing the border, thinking about how hard it was for grandma.  Maybe part of me feels like there's always a chance they may change their mind about us, see the mistake they made with her, and keep us all out forever.  My heart was pounding when they pulled us over for inspection, and stopped dead when they found the port.  It was too much! I've never been so ashamed.  The looks the guards gave us were devastating.  I may not have a criminal record from this, but I feel permanently unsettled, like I enjoyed myself too much to live up to the legacy of my grandmother.",1,"My husband and I went on vacation to Canada.

I loved the sound of the Falls, the depth of it and the length of the waterfall itself. During our vacation my husband and I stayed in a hotel room at The Hilton. Although the hotel was large and clean our room was next to the stair well and was very noisy so we did not sleep well. Despite that we still enjoyed ourselves. During the vacation we had a high quality steak dinner at a beautiful restaurant, visited the casino and walked around the mall. We didn't win anything at the casino! During our trips to the mall we sampled hot sauces (bought some) and sampled the local wine which I found to be very sweet tasting. It was at this mall that I bought a dress for an upcoming wedding. It was at this mall where we saw the food critic during dinner: We had just placed our food order when a lady sat down behind us and ordered several items from the menu. She also asked questions and asked to be re-seated twice. It was obvious she was a restaurant critic. We asked her who she worked for but she just laughed and wouldn't say. On the way home we stopped at the duty free store and bought some Canadian whisky and a bottle of the wine we had sampled.

My friend is not the most romantic type of guy.  I wanted him to have a special moment with his girlfriend so I went along with it.  I told him I'd look into it at night when I was off of work.  We collaborated via chat from then on out to look for the perfect scenario.  We decided that a romantic dinner on the beach would be perfect for them.  I even got to add more details to help him out since he was drawing a blank.  I suggested that there be a live band playing some romantic songs as well so it wasn't awkward silence when he got down on one knee.  He really liked that idea.  He's kind of an awkward guy at heart.  We planned it out until we had all the details perfectly planned.  We even had a little runthrough a few hours before he was going to ask his girlfriend to marry him.  I recorded the whole thing because his girlfriend would definitely get a kick out of it.  It was finally time for the big moment and I had to wait a few hours before he texted me that she had said yes!  He had sent me a picture of her wearing the engagement ring in the exact spot we had planned.

My journey started with the abdominal pain and has now lead me to treatment for infertility with some amazing doctors.  I had been having abdominal pain for years and was told by three different doctors that I just had scar tissue from a previous surgery and it would probably get better. Needless to say,  it only got worse.  I had to go for surgery for an infection in my abdominal wall which ended up being not infection, just inflammation from the endometriosis.  They did a biopsy of a ""mass"" as the doctor called it, which ended up being endometriosis.  With this new diagnosis, I then knew why I have been unable to have kids and that was for sure the reason I hurt almost constantly for the past several years. Finally in May I was able to start the fertility treatments. I was so excited and overwhelmed. That now give me the hope that one day I will possibly be having my own little baby.  It has been a trying time and for sure a very emotional one. The hormones make me feel, at times, that I am going to go crazy,  but in the long run I know it will be well worth the wait. I have an enormous support system. My doctors, friends, family and my boyfriend have been by my side the whole time since I have started with the fertility specialists.  The pills I take are usually not that bad on me,  however the shot that I have to take is what really gets me.  I have to stick myself in the belly with a NEEDLE!! I never saw myself being able to do that. The shot leaves a small red spot around where I take it and it is a little sore for several days. We have already finished three rounds of the medication and shots only.  I think we are going to try and start IUI/IVF in the next few months to give us a greater chance of having a baby.  I know that it will help me to increase my chances of pregnancy. Hopefully in the next year we will be welcoming our own little baby into this world.

My boyfriend was so mad when I told him that I wasn't packed and ready to move in the day before I was to move in. I had to sit down and really make him understand that I was just nervous. I was definitely taking the move seriously. I just could not fathom leaving everything I knew and was used to for the unknown.

My boyfriend and I had been preparing to move for a few months, and waited for the call each month from the landlord who would tell us when an apartment became available. Finally, that call came in August that we could move into an open apartment in September. Each day leading up to the move, I'd either think about what I needed to pack or pack a few things in boxes. There wasn't much of an urgency until the day before. Things didn't seem real until moving day.  I woke up at 8 a.m. so I could meet the landlord at 9:30 a.m. It was extremely nerve-racking since the process was new to me. I arrived before my boyfriend and waited on the lobby couch. I spent the next ten minutes texting my friends and family.  My boyfriend finally entered the room and I was relieved. We began signing papers and getting all of that sorted out. We both were eager to finish that task so we could start the apartment walkthrough.  My first time walking into the apartment was surreal. I couldn't believe that I would be living with my boyfriend of two years and away from my parents. I looked around at the large space and still couldn’t fathom that that was my new home. I waited for it to sink in. The  apartment had that ""new"" apartment smell of cleaning materials.  It was so empty at first, even with all the boxes and furniture. I'm still getting settled in.

We had been dating for about 6 months prior to the breakup. Everything was going okay enough, but recently we had started fighting more often and his communication skills left something to be desired. I remember I told him that we needed to talk, and asked him to give me a call when he got done with work. I sat in my car in the Target parking lot waiting for his call for a couple hours. I like to have difficult conversations in my car, because it feels intimate, but then I have the option to drive and clear my head. My stomach dropped when my music cut out and saw his name on the phone screen. We small talked for a few minutes, and the conversation felt strained/off on both our sides. I finally let him know the reason I wanted to talk is because I just couldn't do this anymore. I had spent so much time recently being unhappy and emotional, and I didn't see a pathway out of that for us. There was a lot of silence and ""I wasn't expecting this"". He acknowledged that he hadn't been listening to what I told him I wanted and needed, so he was beating himself up and blaming himself. We both cried, a lot on the call. I tried to reassure him that I respected him and didn't have any bad feelings toward him, it's just a relationship wasn't working for us. He was so kind and had so many nice things to say to me, that in that moment I wondered if I was doing the right thing. The whole conversation was so emotional and I'll never forget hanging up that phone, and feeling a weight being lifted off me. I did the right thing, for both of us.",3,"What happened was after many contentious fights, I broke up with my boyfriend.

Now that I have been diagnosed with cancer, my wife is struggling even more. After finding out, during a phone call with my daughter, I asked her if she would be willing to move back closer to home, at least temporary, to provide support and be there for her mother.  Two weeks ago, I learned that she has requested a leave from her job, and is renting the house next door to us for the next couple of months. Hearing that, was a sign of relief. Having Christina here the past couple of weeks has been so helpful, Chemotherapy is taking a toll on me, I don't have as much energy to do the things I did before. I am so grateful for my wife and daughter, I can only hope I make it through this and am able to live until I am old, wrinkly, and white haired with Angie.

She complained of extreme fatigue, nausea, and felt that she was getting bloated. I suggested she go to the doctor, which she was not a fan of, and this went on for three more days. Finally, one snowy Friday evening, she was getting a ride home from a co-worker and called me. She said she was feeling much worse, including dizziness and abdominal pain. I asked her co-worker (who was also a friend of ours) to drive her to the emergency room and I set out to meet her there. It was snowing so hard that I missed the turn to the hospital, so I it took me a while to get there but I got there right before they called her back. She looked terrible, and I instantly regretted not being more adamant with my suggestion that she see a doctor earlier. They did quite a few tests, and we talked to several different doctors and nurses. Eventually they knew that she was having serious kidney problems, but there was more going on as well. After about seven hours, around midnight, they admitted her and we moved up to a room, where she was the only patient. Another hour after that and a different doctor came to tell us that she had cirrhosis, which is eventually fatal without a transplant. She's not much of a drinker, and they said that it's due to what's called a fatty liver. She took the news in stride, asking what she needed to do moving forward, and I was very proud of her strength. I drove home around 3 that morning to try to get some sleep, moving at a crawl on icy roads, knowing that our lives were going to be much different now. It turns out that both of her grandfathers died of the same thing. She is determined not to go that way, and is now in Denver, staying with her parents, about to finally get on the transplant list. I am still in Albuquerque, holding down the fort - they don't do transplants here (for real) so this is the only way we can try get her healthy again.",5,My wife suddenly became ill.

There are so many Ricardos - more than one hundred and fifty! - so I don't get to see many of my family members for years at a time. There are some family members I've only ever seen at our reunion, which we have every five years. But, every five years, every Ricardo, young and old, gets together at a big park in Wyoming. There are a few branches of the family living in Wyoming, and it's the easiest state for most of my family to travel to, so that's why we always hold it there. Everyone brings lots of food - tons of Ricardo home cooking! It always seems like, somehow, everyone leaves with more leftovers than they initially brought to the reunion. The youngest Ricardo is my cousin Jimmy; he's about six months old now, but he was only three months at the time of the reunion! In a few weeks, there'll be a new youngest Ricardo - with a family this big, ""the baby of the family"" isn't the baby for very long. The oldest Ricardo is my great-grandmother Rosa. She turned ninety-eight years old right before the reunion! She has so much family knowledge stored in her little old brain. Tons of Ricardo family recipes, stories, and it seems like, somehow, she has the entire family tree memorized. At the reunion, the kids ran around the park and played while the parents chatted and caught up. We all ate a big meal together at the picnic tables under some trees. Afterwards, we all gathered around great-grandmother Rosa. She always spends hours at every reunion telling us old stories. It was a wonderful reunion, and I was so glad to get to spend time with my great-grandma! Ninety-eight is a long time to live, but she keeps surprising us! I can't wait to listen to more of her stories at the next reunion, when she'll be one hundred and three years old!",4,The oldest living Ricardo family member was was 98 years old.

The Ricardo Family Reunion was to be held as a 2 day event, staring on Saturday, June 20th and Sunday, June 21st.  It was a lovely day.  On Saturday we held a family picnic at the Pavilion.  My family came from everywhere Franklin Louisiana, New Orleans Louisiana, Houston Texas, Phoenix Arizona, and Los Angeles California.  We played baseball, basketball, volleyball and the kids had a water slide.   We had a large selection of food.   We traced our family generation back as far as 9 generation. We learned so much about where we came from and how strong of a family line we have.   The children enjoyed them self, playing with cousin they and Aunts and Uncles that just met or haven't seen in a long time.    My great-great-great grandfather was an Indian Chief.  We learn that we belong to the Cherokee Indians.  My family is mixed with Spanish, and French.   We listen to stories told my the elders about events that had happen in their days.  We were told stories about how the family stayed and worked together.   We talked about the many fishing boats that the family had on Grand Isles.   We also visited Madewood plantation where  my Grandfather, Mr. Ricardo, had done a lot of work in restoring the plantation.  We even went to New Orleans and toured the city.  We visited  where my grandfather, Mr. Ricardo,  had did some work in the French Quarter.  The next day we all celebrated by going to Mass together.  Being with family is a blessing and sometime we let the world and material things get in our way and make us forget about what is important.

Knowing how to say goodbye, and dealing with the sense of loss that can follow, is part of being a parent. The pain of separation can go far beyond simply missing your son or daughter after they're gone. Some parents feel a very real sense of grief and loss; a lack of purpose or control. Because having a child leave home to go to university is regarded as a measure of success – a sign that you have prepared them for the world – the downsides are often not adequately acknowledged. Parents are told dismissively to buck up, get a hobby or a cat and start seeing friends more – but ""empty nest syndrome"" can hard to cope with. A myth that surrounds empty nest syndrome is that it is only applicable to stay-at-home mothers, who have shaped their life around the nurturing of their children. In reality, it can affect any kind of parent, whether you have a separate career or not. Lillian Little says: ""I thought I would never suffer from empty nest syndrome – I'm a college professor with a PhD – I thought only pathetic women with no life beyond their kids had no problem with this."" But Little was afflicted by a sense of ""life-altering loss"".Having a job outside of the house can provide structure and distraction, but by no means immunisation. Family Lives found that so many parents experience pain at an empty nest that they set up a specific advice line for the problem. Making a plan for the initial goodbye gives a framework and can be comforting. It's worth sorting out the practical aspects in advance. Are you going to drop them off in their new home, or are they getting there by themselves? How will you travel, where will you park, what public transport will you use? And once you're there, how long are you going to stay for? Resolving these issues well ahead of time means that on the day itself all the technical issues are sorted, and you ""only"" have the emotional aspect to cope with.",2,"The day was bitter-sweet at the same time.

It's hard to find a time to fit this into my schedule, but I settled on 7:30 PM in my apartment. I do various exercises, but one of the main ones is running in place. I should mention that before I describe the surprising event, I had not exercised in about three days for various reasons. Anyway, on a Monday morning I was working at home when the doorbell rang. This was very strange, since no one visits my apartment at this time, and I had no deliveries. So got up and looked through the peephole to see three old ladies standing outside. I didn't know what to think of this, so I opened my door curiously. The tallest of the old ladies stood in the middle and explained that she lives in the apartment below me, and she's concerned about the jumping around at about 8:00 because it shakes her ceiling. Someone else said that the three of them were friends, and they were going out for a walk, and would go to Kenya soon (not sure why that was mentioned). They said the floors were thin (I had thought they were solid--the floors of my previous apartment were very thin,) and everything in her apartment shakes, so I should exercise in the gym. I said sure, sorry about that, etc. I didn't mention how they slam the doors in the apartment below me after I've gone to bed, but it sounds like her complaint was bigger than mine. So now I'm trying to redesign my exercise routine without any jumping or running. I might have to actually go to the gym, though I don't really feel like it.",1,"A neighbor from the apartment below visited me on a Monday morning to complain about her shaking apartment.

I was driving home and I noticed an old dog trying to cross the road. The dog was clearly old by the way it moved and it was not even wearing a collar. I got worried about it's safety so I jumped out and got a collar and leash and i had in my trunk. The dog seemed friendly enough but they were clearly scared of me and I didn't want to put it in more danger so I kind of shepherded it towards the side of the road. From there I was able to approach the dog and get close enough to put a collar and leash on it. Ok so where do I go from here I thought to myself as the dog had no collar or tags, and it was slightly past 9:30 at night. Thankfully my house was close by so I walked the dog into my garage and gave it some dog treats and water as it looked exhausted. This gave me some time to figure out what I would do next. I ended up making a big sign that I could post on the  street corner nearby thinking that its owners would be out looking for it. After the dog was refreshed a bit from some food and water I got a new idea. Since I couldn't call animal control at that time of night, I was left with a few options. Keep the dog for the night and call for it to be picked up in the morning. Or put the leash back on the dog and see if it would try to walk its way home. I chose the latter so off we went in the dark following the road until we got a few blocks away from where I lived. At this point the dog was trying to turn off of the road into some very dark paths and I was hesitant to go off the beaten path with my new friend. At this point a car turned onto the street and pulled into it's driveway, I thought It would be a good chance to ask a neighbor if they had a clue whose dog this was. As luck turns out they new the dog and pointed me to the home where it's family is and other than an awkward door knocking situation late at night everything went well and I was able to reunite the dog with its family.",1,"I found a dog wandering the road late at night.

It was trully special because I have been wanting it for years and I finally gotten it. We played for hours and even had to take a break.  I will never forget those moments as me and my cousin played side by side for hours on a day between our birthdays. We trully felt like we shared those moments. We caught pokemon that was different then eachothers and we battled them as we caught new ones. We just simply linked our gameboys and played agianst eachother.

It all started out 4 years ago when my Uncle who owns a couple of event planning companies asked me to come work for him since his main company just received a huge contract from the federal government. I said yes right away and quit my job as an assistant manager at a hotel and left for Virginia to work for him. He offered to let me stay in his basement which was just a really nice downstairs apartment. I was very grateful and stayed with him for a year until I saved enough money to get in to my own place. At first I really enjoyed the job and put in my best effort. The two owners, my Uncle and his best friend were very happy with my performance. I was given a 50% raise after only six months on the job. After a year, I was promoted and given another significant raise. After being promoted I was put under the supervision of a new boss. She was very good at her job but unfortunately was not good with the people working under her. She would talk very badly behind our backs and would not think twice about throwing us under the bus if it would keep her from looking bad. I worked for her for a couple of years until finally I and a few others had had enough. I complained to my Uncle and his best friend who was also my old supervisor. They did not believe that she was such a problem. My work ethic started to decline because I was very discouraged by it all. I started to not take things seriously and then began to spiral out of control to a certain extent. I was not the only one on the team with this issue. Finally I tried to quit several times but was quilted into staying on the job. Then over the course of one week I purposely did not show up for a few days until they were forced to fire me. It was a hard thing to deal with considering how my uncle who I was very close to looked out for me in several ways and because of that we became very close. The fallout was not pleasant and because of it all the relationship between me and my uncle is now severely strained and I will never work for him again.",2,This was the story of how I was hired by my uncle to work at his company.

I was shocked when my now husband asked me ""Didn't you know Janet?"" and I said ""Man, Janet! Yes! Why?"" and he told me that she had passed away. I was shocked! I went to her funeral and talked to old friends of ours. They started talking about how we all went for coffee and donuts before it became a huge fad with teens. After the funeral, I went to Dunkin Donuts and got a dozen donuts and a large coffee. I sat in the parking lot eating and crying. I wish I could say that that was the only time I did that. It wasn't. I did this every week for months. Sometimes, when I got really sad, I'd do it multiple times. In 3 months, I gained 25 pounds. I knew I had to get a hold of myself.

I was really sad about a friend I had, because she said she was moving away the day that school ended. I was so distraught I couldn't bring myself to say anything to her, since it was too painful for me to remember how I would never see her again. I ended up bolting out of my last class and heading to the local market, where I bought a maple bar and coffee. Maple bars and coffee ended up being a ritual of sorts for me after that day. I bought a 20 dollar store card at that same market and redeemed it for a video game, which I played for an hour before breaking down in tears. I wished at the time things were different, that I didn't have her leave my life. I was certain, at least at the time, that I had met someone very special to me. Fast forward a couple of years, and I no longer speak to her. Part of me wishes that I kept in touch, but I realize now that people have to move one. No matter how painful or uncomfortable it may be.

There was another picture of the football field, full of chairs and the crowd looking out at the graduates. As much as I am happy for her, I wanted to forget about school. I felt alone because everyone else was so happy. She wasn't the only classmate that reached out to me. I heard from a guy I took English Composition with and my roommate from sophomore year. My former roommate told me about the night that she wanted to drop out of everything. She said that if I hadn't been there to support her, things would be different not only for her, but her family. I got several texts from senior seminar classmates thanking me for being a great team member, for helping them study. I am glad that I could avail myself to so many people and that something I did mattered.  Still, I did not regret my decision to attend graduation and that this part of my life is over.",1,"On graduation day I felt bad seeing photos of those who attended graduation since I did not.

I never planned to go to graduation. I said I was getting out and never ever looking back. It costs money just to travel there and have the outfit. And I don't like it there nor do I like the people. I look back on my time there as struggle and pain. But I looked at Facebook the morning of graduation and there was a small pain. Seeing two of my almost friends in their caps and gowns, with their families made me slightly sad for what I didn't have. Finishing didn't feel like a celebration and maybe had I gone I could have made it be one. They had been through struggles similar to mine and they were there, in the gowns, celebrating. I could have gone and seen them off, and gave that university and city where I spent so many years of my life a proper goodbye. So I sat there, looking at Facebook, thinking about how the last time I left I didn't know it was going to be the last time. I realized that part of why I hadn't wanted to go was because most of my friends had graduated years before and I wasn't really close to anyone else. Dragging them back for my graduation wasn't something I felt comfortable doing. And I realized that somewhere deep inside I had seen myself being dragged into graduation, begrudgingly going. But people had listened when I said no. Facebook, ignoring privacy as usual, alerted one of my almost friends I was online. She sent me message asking where I was and if we could meet to take photos together. When I told her I was not there she expressed disappointment. She wrote me a message about how sad it was to not see me as she saw me as directly responsible for her even making it to graduation. At the same time, other almost friends who had graduated previously were online congratulating the two. Upon seeing I was online, they wrote to me as well. One expressed congratulations to me and spoke of how she was glad I was finally free. The other spoke of how we would celebrate in the future, as I had celebrated her graduation with her and she could not have gotten through without me. And I told myself that I didn't need to be at that graduation because I had what I needed from it--the people who understood how much it took and the feeling of being free of it.",1,"On graduation day I felt bad seeing photos of those who attended graduation since I did not.

I want to say that it's the beer that caused it but it's me. My behaviour has driven my wife and kids away. She took them to stay with her mother in California and I can't stay sober long enough to drive and go see them. I wasn't always this way but after I lost my job, I lost my purpose. I feel so cold and desolate all the time. Or at least, I felt. Even though I am no different, I have the hope that I can change. I've found religion and its my faith in its power that I've told my loved ones that I will change. So paradoxically, my lie was not at all insincere. When she left that morning two weeks ago, I went for comfort in what gave me misery in the first place. I took a case of beer from the basement and I drank and cried. It wasn't until my last beer that I looked into myself, drunk though I was, and realized that I must change. I went to the bookshelf and took up the only book I thought had power - power for me to overcome. I spilled my beer purposely while alone in the house. As I read the verses in John, I felt strength that I never had before and I stumbled to the sink to pour the beer out. I threw out my whole stash.

I didn't know that one of the caps on my beer was off and when I got up it split and went everywhere I was furious about the situations. But I tried to control myself I just got me another beer and drank on it. My life was not competently over it was just very dramatic for me. I will not of now one let the cap of my beer fall off and not look to make sure ts still there. My wife face times me and I told her about my story and she laughed but really I didn't think it was that funny I was crying. She had the kids face timing me to and there were laughing to. I was bored after a little whial without the kids and my wife being at the house. It was very quite and a little to quite at moments. But the next day I ended up staying the night with them and then the kids came home with me after that day. We ate spaghetti and meatball that night and watched a movie and just hung out with the family. But after that my wife got her peace time but she got bored after a whial and lolly I think she missed just the kids. but she says she missed me to. We love watching the dog because that is more money but being away from family is hard. My wife and my children are my world and I don't know what I would do without them. We have some great times and some not so great times but I wouldn't change it for the world. It was nice having a little break from all the notice. But also it was a lot quieter.

I hadn't seen or spent much time with my grandfather in years so I was surprised at this request. Nevertheless, I accepted the responsibility. I spent some time putting together all of the details of the service which only took a few hours. Once I was done with that, I started working on writing his eulogy. For a long time, I was stumped about what to say. I thought about how we hadn't seen each other in a while and I began to think that I shouldn't be the one writing his eulogy in the first place. After a few moments, I remembered a day that my grandfather and I spent together when I was about 10 years old. We were on a boat out on the lake with fishing gear. My grandfather wanted to teach me how to fish but I wasn't really interested at the time. I tried to catch fish but they always escaped. I started getting upset. My grandfather could see this and started to pretend the fish got away every time he caught one. He wanted to make sure I didn't feel alone and laughed at himself to show me that fishing wasn't something to be too serious about. It was about spending time with your family and having fun. I finished writing the eulogy and during the service, I read it out loud while my relatives looked on.

He was 91 and an inspiration to me. I am actually his name sake and name after him. It was a great honer to do his eulogy and cover the wonderful accomplishments of such a great man that I have looked up to my entire life. All of my family were in attendance, which was a great thing as most of us haven't seen one another in many years. My grandfather always cared about family and made family the point and purpose of his life. Unfortunately, it required his passing to remind us of the that value. He fathered six children and had 9 grandchildren and 7 great grandchildren and they were all in attendance to honor his home going! Just two years before, in the same month I did my father's funeral and everyone was in attendance there as well. I mention this because at my grandfather's funeral the place was packed, save one empty chair. It was a touching thought that there was one chair left in honor of my father. I mentioned this in the eulogy and hoped that all in the family who know that there is a chair in our home and at the table for everyone one of them! During the funeral I preached a message as well on the lives that are lived as an anchor for others. My Grandfather was most certainly and anchor for all of us as well as grandpa and grandmas house was an anchor for our souls when traveling into town. I also expressed how our faith anchors us in the decisions that we make in life. That many time we can drift too far off course and that life has a way of blowing from our course through storms. Although the winds of life are experienced by everyone, we do not have to allow them to shipwreck us or our faith. Through faith and trust we hold on and are anchored to the rock! This was the way that my grandpa lived and that is the way that I hope to live my life as well. In all it was a bitter sweet event for me and there were tears of sadness and of joy. I am glad that my family trusted me to minister to all in this trying time. I was very humbled and honored to do it.",4,My story is about my grandfathers funeral.

Our next and last trip was in Chattanooga Tennessee, where we stumbled upon two other theme parks. One was definitely one of the smallest ones we have been to, but it had a lot of charm to it. The last one we went to, was a very massive one, almost the size of the Disney world one in Orlando. I think our last theme park was the best one. The rides were fantastic. The food was amazing.

We started at Holiday World in Indiana. They had amazing roller coasters, including one named Voyage, that is now in my top five of all time. They also had tons of great water rides. After that, we went to Kentucky Kingdom. It was a small park, but had some nice coasters. Unfortunately, it was 100 degrees and humid, and for some reason the water park wasn't open. Because of this, we left really early to get to our next destination, Dollywood. Sadly, we had to cancel the visit to Dollywood because of a huge storm. Instead, we continued on to Carowinds, and got to ride Fury 325, which is now my second favorite coaster. We spent two days in Charlotte, where Carowinds is, and then headed to Virginia to go to Kings Dominion. The park was amazing. We both loved intimidator 305 and Twisted Timbers. After this, we headed to Philadelphia to enjoy the city itself, with no theme parks. Our final stop was in Toronto, where we enjoyed the city, and a great theme park, called Canada's Wonderland.

The big thing is that about four months ago, I found out my rat of a husband has been cheating on me. I saw his phone light up one night with a text message while he was in the bathroom, and let's just say that the content of the message was not exactly ""work related"" like he tried to convince me of. After a long fight where he denied everything, I took his phone and called the number who sent the text. A woman answered, as expected. His face immediately went bright red. Then he confessed everything. Apparently he had been seeing this woman for about two years. When I heard that my jaw basically hit the floor, and I pretty much lost it at that point. We have been married for 20 years for pete's sake! His job forces him to travel quite often for overnight stays, so it makes perfect sense. I always suspected he could cheat on me at one of those conventions he attends for work, but he honestly never gave me a sign or a red flag. What a jerk! Anyway, there's not much left to be said about our relationship, or what is left of it. I filled out the divorce paperwork last week and it should be finalized soon.

She was driving home from work in the rain when she lost control of her car and get into an accident on the interstate. It feels like I was just talking to her and planning our next get together. We'd planned to go to a concert with my brother and sister in July. I didn't like the artist that we were going see, but it was for her birthday that we'd missed doing something for in February. She had been waiting to go that concert for years but hadn't been able to because our work schedules didn't line up. I considered my sister-in-law as much one of my actual siblings as my brother and sister are. She'd been there for my wife and I through some hard times and was always willing to lend a hand to help us with the children. I can't believe that she's gone and I know that it's tougher on my wife. This is a very tragic time for both of our families, because she was really a light in our lives. My family is pulling through as best we can and are making sure that we are there for each other in this trying time. The funeral was difficult, but it was attended by so many people and my sister-in-law would've really been happy to know how many lives she touched when she was still here. I think that if anything good can come out of this is that we'll be more of a bonded family. We know that's what she would've wanted us to do and we'll honor her in this way.

She was scheduled to have knee replacement surgery before she passed away.  She was having a normal day on the day she passed away.  She had a meeting with someone from her church that morning.  She went outside to show her friend her garden and then her friend left.  She was in her garden when she suddenly had a massive aneurysm.  We had video footage from security cameras to show us exactly what happened.  She put her hands to her head and then she dropped to 1 knee.  She braced herself temporarily before falling to the ground completely.  My brother found her a few minutes later and called an ambulance.

Or rather, we went panning. It was a lot of fun. We'd originally gone to do a highland games festival, but couldn't make it. Since we were up there anyways, and had children with out group (as well as myself, the resident mental child haha,) we looked for other things to do. We wound up walking around a tourist trap attached to our camp ground, though the gem experience we wanted to do there was closed. One of the kids, the only girl, announced that her dad had promised her this last year that he'd take her gem mining. So I looked online and found something just down the road. We hopped in a minivan, one person sitting on the floor, and scooted across the road to this one nearest to us. We only spent $75 for 8 of us, which was pretty good for well over an hours entertainment. We all ended up with at least three precious gems. Most of us had more. My husband and I had the fewest, mostly due to the kids realizing I know rocks and asking me for lots of help. The little girl found a geode in one of our buckets as well. The kids later crushed it with a rock. They couldn't wait for us to find a hammer to crack it for them. It was cute, how excited they were. And that way, every kid got a piece.

It was such a fun experience! We definitely paid for it, but overall, it was pretty cheap. Less than ten dollars a head. The only bummer is that it was a panning experience, not a true mining experience. We didn't do any digging. We just played in the mud and slurry (that's water filled with mud and rock particles, specific to mining and sundry.)I wound up pegging myself as the ""rock lady."" Everyone was asking my opinion about rocks! Not to toot my own horn, but I correctly identified seven types of precious and semi-precious stones. I would up bringing home three emeralds, a sapphire, and a ruby. One of the kids found a massive geode. Each of the kids found at least three precious stones. It was so exciting! They were all just as thrilled as I was. I swear, I came off as more excited than they did. But then, I really well and truly love rocks. The biggest surprise about the whole experience was how many gems we found. I always worry that the kind of ""tourist-y"" attractions are scams, but sure enough, we struck gold! (Figuratively speaking.) I haven't had that much fun in years. I loved every minute of it, and have extracted promises to do the experience again in the future.

The fact that I got to catch up with her while also getting to visit Budapest made it even better. Neither of us have ever been to Hungary before and it was a great bonding experience. Of course there where the expected difficulties communicating with locals and finding our way around an unfamiliar city. But we stuck together and helped each other out. Over all we found the people of Budapest to be friendly and helpful. One of my favorite places was the  Gellert Bath and Spa centre because who doesn't enjoy a spa day.  After several days of site seeing it was nice to relax and enjoy a massage. Of course there where plenty of other things to see. Jen liked the Parliament building .  Being into history we both like Hero's square.  The House of Terror was an interesting look at Hungary's more recent history. We also enjoyed the the local flea market. It was great seeing a little piece of everyday life in Budapest. The Buda Hills also offered a great day away from the city. We enjoyed a nice bike ride along the trails.

It was such a lovely trip. We took a boat ride a sunset over the beautiful water and were able to see the parliament building lit up at night. We ate absolutely amazing food. I had initially been worried they had a very meat-centric diet, and as a vegetarian I thought I wouldn't get to enjoy authentic dishes but I had some delicious goulash and many other unique plates at restaurants. I bought a jacket that I absolutely love one day when were walking down the street of our airbnb. We stumbled upon a hole in the wall thrift shop, it had such beautiful pieces. I easily could have bought many things but settled for a cute vibrant blue cropped blazer. I have worn it many times since and always get complements. My friend and I still talk about the trip to this day, we had such an amazing time together. Our feet were about to fall off from all the walking we did, but it truly gave us the best experience in seeing the most we could in our short time. One of the most surprising and beautiful moments of the trip was definitely when we went to the fisherman's lookout. I had not known what to expect because one moment we were on level ground and the next we came out of a tunnel that offered us the most stunning view of Budapest and the river. We had a cocktail at the top and just soaked in the beauty of the moment.

Three weeks ago I took a trip to Budapest, Hungary with one of my childhood best friends. I was already in Europe because I had been working in Madrid, Spain. I took a short flight, and met met my friend in Hungary. She was pretty jet lagged since she came from the United States but we went out for dinner that night. We were absolutely blown away with how delicious Hungarian food is. We had delicious stew and soup. I was worried initially about how the food would be. I do not eat meat, and I read prior that Hungarians love their meat, but I had no trouble finding vegetarian options. The next day on our trip, we saw the beautiful Parliament building, and a beautiful castle. I remember walking up many stairs and getting tired in the hot, summer sun. Suddenly though, we reached an archway that took us to the end of the tunnel. There was sunlight peaking through and some of the most beautiful architecture I had ever seen. I saw beautiful mosaics, and a cobblestone square that overlooked the entire city of Budapest. Perfectly situated was a bar where we could sit down and look out at the view of the city and parliament building on the other side of the water. It was absolutely breathtaking and my favorite part of the trip. A close second for my favorite part of the trip was a sunset boat ride we took that allowed us to later see the lit up buildings at night. We finished our last day of the trip with going to the famous baths. It was perfect timing to relax after having walked many miles the days before. The baths are said to have healing qualities, but regardless, I found them very relaxing.  This trip was amazing overall, I really enjoyed sharing an international experience with one of my best friends.

She was a heavier girl with greasy hair and clothes that were obviously hand me downs or thrift store buys. I knew that she most likely didn't have the best life, based on the way that she acted. She would constantly curse or make sex jokes or jokes about drugs, and at 13 it seemed like she was trying too hard to prove she was mature. While her life was probably a string of bad parenting mistakes and school punishments from lashing out, but it still didn't excuse her severe bullying. She would lean against her locker and glare at me as I passed by, calling out mean questions like, ""Do you have a dick?"" or ""Why are you staring at me, you fucking lesbian?"" I wasn't the only one she tormented. I would hear her lashing out at other girls, and even some of the more timid boys. Her favorite insults to hurl at the boys were often ""Faggot!"" or ""Pussy!"" Because of her aggressive behavior, she didn't have many friends but that doesn't mean that she didn't have any. Her wannabe gang was comprised of two other girls and one boy, all of which seemed to have been brought up in less than fortunate circumstances. Their crew was known for smoking pot, vandalizing, and being in detention. About 6 months ago, I finally stood up to my bully. We were in P.E. and all of the girls were in the locker room. It was mandatory to change into gym clothes before P.E. started. Everyone faced inward toward their locker, trying to block out the rest of the half naked girls. Except for my bully, who turned toward me and pulled down the elastic waistband of my gym shorts, then loudly exclaimed, ""My bad, just wanted to finally see once and for all if you really did have a dick"", while she laughed sarcastically. I straightened up, with my shorts still down around my knees and quietly breathed out, ""We all know you just act out because you have a shitty life."" The girls around me quietly giggled. My bully turned away, looking hurt. I thought she'd lash out, but the public embarrassment seemed to actually bother her.A few hours later, when we were all waiting for the buses around the back of the school, my bully came up to me. ""Hey, dickwad.""""...Hey."" I said back.""That wasn't cool, what you did before - you don't know my life, bitch.""""You're right I don't know your life... but I'm just calling how everyone sees it. Why do you think everyone laughed when I said it.""It seemed to dawn on her that the way she had been acting wasn't funny or cool, and was actually contributing to her loneliness. The rest of the school year, she didn't call out mean things to people passing by or get a detention so she seemed to have taken what I said to heart and actually tried to change her behavior.",1,Coming face to face with a childhood bully gave me a better understanding of how it was all harmless and fun.,180.0,0.023175087218987755,,0.007581793007403803,0.010583352970741089,0.014807498616960402,0.010899818792040605,,-0.015593294211583952,-0.012591734248246667,-0.008367588602027354,-0.01227526842694715,505,32,4.407920792079208,0.5544554455445545,107,15.875,2,27,50,0,3

One person in particular was someone who really loved to play jokes on people and tease them. I have so many memories of them in particular picking on me. It really resented with me as a child because it was always in the presence of teachers and instead of doing anything about it, they laughed at him. It was some really early memories that I have of not feeling protected. As an adult, I know now that he was just a jokester and someone who loved pranks and joking around but as a kid, I saw it as torment and a bully. Nothing he did was even all that bad, just hiding and jump scaring everyone mostly. As an adult, it was the first time I had seen him in a long time and to be face to face with someone that I considered a bully growing up was so odd. Turns out, he was still joking around and kidding and being the same as I remembered him, but without the childlike thoughts of malice that I used to have. It really made an impact on me seeing him now with eyes that have grown and understood. I mentally forgave him for the pain he put me through as a kid. Some things latch on to you no matter what and being ""picked on"" for me was one of them.  As an adult, I better understood things and seeing him do the same things he did to me (jump scaring, saying he was eating a cat when it was a  regular burger, etc) seeing him do that to other kids, I see how it's harmless.

I wanted to go somewhere less touristy and with more culture, but Tom has wanted to visit the Bahamas ever since his best friend Alex went with her husband. I acquiesced, of course, because I'll do anything to make Tom happy. And he was. He was in Heaven for that entire week. And so, I was pleasantly surprised to find out, was I.The resort was the most luxurious accommodation I have ever experienced. We didn't have to lift a finger for the whole week. New drinks were brought to us at the moment our glasses had become dry. The beach and the water were so beautiful. The water was a vivid turquoise color, just like you see in the commercials. The weather was perfect except for one day, when it rained hard. Tom and I used that time to go to a local cultural museum, which I felt right at home at. I enjoyed learning about the history of the Bahamian people. There were several events that we enjoyed participating in during our stay. Every night there was a dinner where you could eat with other couples. We made these wonderful friends, Jim and Sue, who were our companions throughout the trip. My favorite events were the late night parties. There was dancing under the light of the fire from the tiki torches. The DJ was talented and played a great mix of music, including hits and deep cuts. Everyone was in a cheerful mood, and I found it contagious. My favorite event was the carnival that we attended a few miles away from the resort. There were so many elaborate costumes, amazing food, and live music. Coming home from the trip, I felt utterly relaxed and rejuvenated.

I had to get help so I signed up for alcoholic and narcotics meetings. I attended them everyday once I had gotten together. I never missed a day for about two years. One day there was a meeting for me in which to celebrate my success of not missing any days and being cleaned up. I was finally sober for a good little while now and it felt good.

The most memorable part of this event was being presented with a special token by my sponsor, who had told me that they were unable to attend, yet surprised me by showing up. This was memorable and surprising because a sponsor is someone who plays a very important role in your recovery. They are someone who you trust and who is there for you 24/7 throughout your recovery process and they take on many roles in your life. They are not only your sponsor, but a friend, a confidant, a mentor, someone who helps to guide you, and so much more. Sharing in the milestones, accomplishments, and even the slip ups and downfalls is something that they are there for, so thinking that my sponsor was not going to make it to one of the biggest milestones of my recovery, was a very sad and disappointing moment for me to say the least. One of my close friends in the meetings took the place of my sponsor initially and stood up in front of the room. They apologized that my sponsor was unable to make it and said that they were grateful to be speaking in their place. Then there was some silence and some clapping and hollaring. I stopped and looked around and all of a sudden I saw and heard my sponsor! When they stood up in front of the room and announced their presence, I was extremely surprised and overjoyed! This was something that would have been more than enough, but to have them give a speech and to hear the things that they had to say about me, for me, and to me, truly made it one of the most memorable moments in my life. My sponsor stood in front of the entire room and spoke about my journey in recovery, as well as how we met and how I approached them to be my sponsor. They described me in a way that I could not imagine myself, but made me realize that it was in fact me. They explained how proud they were of me, how far I have come, and expressed their wishes for me for the future. My sponsor told me that they were hesitant at first to take on a new sponsee, but that they were glad that they did because not knowing me and not being a part of my journey would've been a very disappointing thing. They described me as a good friend, a good person, a beautiful person, and someone who is capable of change and acceptance. They wished the best for me in all that I do and in my continued road in recovery. Hearing all of the nice things that they had to say made me cry.

It was a very calm and peaceful morning filled with a lot of excitement and pride. I walked into the meeting feeling a little nervous, but once the leader of the meeting began to speak, my nerves settled and I felt more comfortable and accomplished. The leader made a brief statement about how far I had come in my recovery / journey, how proud she was of me, and how I had touched and affected her life. Once she finished making her speech, she introduced me, as well as presented me with my two year token and a very beautiful cake. Afterwards, my sponsor surprised me by making an appearance. Initially, she had told me that she would be unable to attend, which made me very disappointed because she was and is such an important part of my sobriety and recovery. My sponsor came to the front of the room and made a speech about me and my recovery, which made me cry because it was very emotional. After this, everyone in the room had cake and many of them came up to me individually to congratulate me and praise my success in recovery. Many of the participants of the meeting brought me little gifts and keepsakes, which made me feel very special. One of the gifts I received was a little box that had my sobriety / clean date engraved on it, as well as a very special quote that I find inspiration in. ""For where your treasure is there your heart will be also"". My sponsor gave me a journal that had an inscription inside the front cover from her along with my sobriety / clean date. This was a very memorable event because I have worked very hard to overcome a great deal of vices in my life, including addiction and the underlying conditions and issues that have had an impact on my addiction.

After dropping out when I was younger, I finally decided to go back to college to finish my degree. Though the prospect in front of me seemed much harder than in the past. Now I had to work a job on top of going back to school and that seemed like a lot of hard work. I knew though that if I didn't go back to school, not only would I regret it, but I would be stuck where I was possibly forever. I started by making sure that my job would allow me to go back to school and thankfully they were happy to give me lighter workloads and flexibility. So I started planning my classes and getting ready to work hard. The first few weeks were tough even though I felt I was prepared. Too many times I didn't get enough sleep because I had to study and even had a few night classes. Even with flexible work schedules I still had problems with keeping up with my two responsibilities. However after the first month I felt like my mind and body had adjusted and I was working harder and better. I was also learning many new things in school and I felt I not only could do this, but thrive. All the work and studying made me realize I could do more than I thought I could. I did feel some shame that I didn't do this earlier, but the important thing was that I was doing it now. Hopefully I keep learning and growing as I continue on.",1,This story is about me going back to college.

For years I have not gone to college because of my physical and mental health but decided to try because I have always wanted to complete college. It was hard. My skin conditioned made it painful to sleep let alone study and attend class. I sprained my ankle, gotten the flu and almost quit but I kept going despite having every excuse not to. Then by the end of the semester I was given a ''fun'' assignment by our Psychology professor to do something that would make us feel uncomfortable and write how we overcame that. At the same time I had to give a Ted Talk style speech in my Writing and Research class so this was a great opportunity to do both. I felt uncomfortable and I even regretted it at first but I was able to complete both of my assignments and ended up getting a B+ for each of those classes while getting As for my Math and History class.  This was a roller coaster of emotions but I'm glad I did it. Now I'm stronger to continue on to my next semester which is just one week away. I was surprised at myself. I quit college 3 times the first semester before this so I was afraid I would have to pay for it all again. But it was worth it. Now I'm a step closer to my goal and I feel that I'm not just learning the subject of each class. I'm learning how to take notes better and how to approach real life problems with the tools I've learned in Psychology.",2,This story is about me going back to college.

About two months ago, I had a hard day at work, my boss gave me a second warning about being late and warned me that next time I would be fired. On my way home from work that day, I stopped off at the liquor store and bought a jug of vodka. When I got to my car, I immediately started drinking, I felt so hopeless and like I had nothing to live for. I felt like my boss hated me and it seems like she lets other coworkers get away with a lot more stuff than me. All of my bills are late, my pay check barely covers my bills.  I started the car and started driving, I was going to go drive my car off the make out hill. I got to the top of the hill and my phone rang. My moms picture was staring at me. I knew I couldn’t leave her, she would be devastated if I took my own life. I knew where I could get help, a friend of mine had went to a crisis stabilization unit a few weeks ago because she had started cutting her self again. I googled the address and followed the directions. When I arrived to the parking lot of the init it was a small white building with red and yellow tulips in front. I was ashamed and didn’t want to go in. There was a knock on my car window. I looked up to see a guy in a blue polo shirt looking at me very concerned. I opened the door and he asked if I was alright. I told him I wasn’t and I needed help. He said he would walk me in and help me check in. I was taken into a room and a lady checked that I didn’t have any drugs or weapons. I was given hospital pajamas and told to put them on. All of my personal belongings were taken into the units custody. Soon a psychologist came into give me an evaluation. After I was at this place for seven hours with staff members monitoring me, I was told I could leave if there was someone who would come and get me. I called my mom and she came and picked me up, was so scared she was going to be mad at me, but when she arrived she gave me a huge hug as tears were streaming down her cheeks, she told me she was going to help me with my drinking problem and she loved me.",5,"I admitted myself into a crisis stabilization unit because I was suicidal, drunk and sick of being addicted to alcohol.

I parked my car in the fire lane and walked in. Drunk me figured this was the only way I would be able to kick the almost five year curse that was my addiction to alcohol. Drunk me also reasoned that if I kept drinking the way I was, I would either take my own life or die from organ failure. I went up to the reception area and informed the receptionist I needed to be admitted for intoxication, alcohol addiction and suicidal ideation. I gave her my insurance information, filled out the paperwork, and sat in the lobby. I had stopped before getting to the facility and bought and drank two small wine bottles. I could feel them kicking in and with the alcohol running through my body I sat and waited, convinced this was my only option; the only way I would stay alive. I was called back by a paramedic who took my vitals and had me take a breathalyzer. I was 2 times the legal limit; he said if I drove away before sobering up the cops would be called. Back in the lobby, as the wine started to wear off I felt panic. No longer sure if this was the right move, I wondered if walking home was an option. In front of me a door opened and a bald man called me into his office. The substance abuse counselor asked me some generic questions about my addiction, and informed me I would have to stay for 24 hours. I would not be able to keep my phone, I would need to change out of my clothing, and I would be in a room being monitored. Sobering up, I was almost certain I was ready to walk home. A very attractive nurse came out, and explained that I would be strip searched. I still had some liquid courage in me and told her absolutely not, and refused to sign the consent form. I told her I would sit in the lobby and sober up. She left, and I called my mom, angry that they not only would take my phone, but that I would have to expose myself to a stranger. My mother convinced me to admit myself, and so I did. The staff in the unit were nice enough, but I could tell they thought my case was not that bad. There were people in the unit being constantly monitored in case of a seizure; my hands were not even shaking as the alcohol wore off. I sat in a chair and watched movies, paced around, called my mother from the only phone in the room. Seven hours later, I was able to drive and they discharged me, at which point I drove home and drank some more.",4,"I admitted myself into a crisis stabilization unit because I was suicidal, drunk and sick of being addicted to alcohol.

My parents had just gotten a divorce and my dad decided he wanted to move to Florida, leaving my mom, whom I didn't have the best relationship with, and I, in Atlanta, GA. I've always been a daddy's girl but I kept a lot from my dad to maintain my innocence in his eyes. Following my parents' divorce, I started hanging out later, I was drinking, I was using marijuana, and I was promiscuous. My grades suffered and I had begun spending time with multiple guys just for the fun of it. I was filling a void that my dad could no longer fill. Though I was spending time with multiple guys, I had strong feelings for one, Joshua. Joshua was smart, funny, a good listener, popular, handsome, a gentleman, and still a tough guy. I knew I was a lucky girl so eventually I dropped the other guys and committed myself to Joshua. But prior to commitment, I made the mistake of sleeping with both Joshua, and another guy, Corey, around the same time. Two months later, I realized my period was late, I was nauseous all of the time, and I had weird sensations in my body that were flu like. I told my best friend Ashley at the time about my symptoms and she told me that she would go to the dollar store with me the following day to get a pregnancy test since they were just as reliable as the name brand tests, but cheap. The next day, Ashley and I went to the Dollar Tree and purchased three pregnancy tests just in case I messed one up. I took the test at her house since her parents weren't home and I didn't want to risk running in to my mom at home. It was at this time that I found out that I was pregnant. I was scared, worrying about what I would do with a baby, and wondering whose baby it was. My mom was disappointed, I couldn't tell my dad myself that his princess was pregnant, and while Ashley was excited, it wasn't enough support to raise a baby. I needed stability, support, a job, personal growth, and I needed to finish school. My only hope was Joshua but he was not too happy about the fact that I was unsure of who the baby's father was and respectfully told me that he wanted nothing to do with me but that he would be a friend and see my decision to the end with me. Corey also wanted nothing to do with me, as far as he was concerned, I was a hoe. I felt like my only option was to terminate my pregnancy. I cried days before ending my pregnancy, during the process, and days following the procedure. I was broken, and I felt alone and helpless because I never wanted to have an abortion but I had no one. Now five years later, I find out that my dad would have been willing to help me raise my baby had he have known I was with child, but neither me nor my mom mentioned it to him. Though I was happy to hear that my dad would have had my back through whatever, I am heartbroken that I terminated my pregnancy out of fear, and I don't know how soon i'll ever be able to forgive myself.",3,I had an abortion at the age of 18 because I though I had no one that would help me out.

I carried this child for approximately 3 months and fell I love with it.  I had an illness, aside from the pregnancy, at that time and knew that I would need some assistance in caring for the child.  The father of the child did not want to be a part of this baby's life so I ha no one to turn to but my parents.  The night before the abortion I ended up telling my mom what had happened and what was going to happen the next day.  I basically begged her for help at this point, and I remember saying how much I hated myself and how I did not want to go through with the procedure.  My mom told me that she had no choice but to tell my dad and I begged her not to, fearing his reaction.  This was the last interaction that I had with my mom and I was under the impression that she told my dad, as he did not say anything to me the entire night.  The next day I went through with the procedure.  For the past 18 years I thought that my dad knew about this until a few months ago.  My sister told me that he told her that he did not find out until 5 years after the fact that I was indeed pregnant.  He told me sister that my mom phrased it as a question to him, asking what he would do if he found out that I was pregnant.  Instead of telling my mom that he would make me have the abortion he said that they would have no choice but to help me.  If I had known this 18 years ago I definitely would not have gone through with the procedure.

At the age of 18 I had an abortion.  The reason for the abortion was that I was going through an illness at the time and I would have needed some assistance, but was led to believe that no one would help me.  The night before the procedure I came home and told my mom what was going on.  I was crying, begging her to help me and I remember specifically stating that this was not something that I wanted to do and that I hated myself for doing so.  My mom told me that she was going to tell my father and, seeing as how he did not speak to me during that time, I was under the assumption that he knew and that was the reason that he chose not to speak to me. About 4 months ago, my sister disclosed that my mom did not tell my dad that I was pregnant as the time and instead phrased it as a question, asking what he would do if he found out that I was pregnant.  When he was asked this question my father stated that they would have no choice but to help me out.  This was never disclosed to me so I went ahead with the abortion, thinking that I had no one on my side.  To make matters even worse, my mom did not disclose my pregnancy to my father until 5 years after the fact.  I am now left carrying tremendous guilt and hatred for myself because of what I had done, and everything could have been avoided.  This revelation has opened up a new wound and I now feel as though I am dealing with this all over again.  I do not know what to say to my mom, let alone how to approach the topic altogether.

It took us about 2 and a half hours to get there but it didn't feel like a long drive at all. We had rented out an Airbnb which was really comfortable. Once we got there, we ordered some Chicago deep-dish pizza at Lou Malnati's before heading to the game. We took a Lyft to the game and walking up to the field was very exciting. I didn't know that Wrigley Field is a historic baseball field but it is. Once inside, it was exactly like the movies show it to be. All the concessions and vendors and seating looked familiar because of the American media. We got there after the game had already started and the Cubs had the lead. I am not very proficient at baseball rules so I had a tough time fully following the game but it was fun regardless.

It’s taken a long time for me to come to grips with what’s transpired, but I feel I am finally ready to put it into words. I remember it was beautiful that day. I was at work wishing I wasn’t. Imagine my surprise when the line shut down and they sent us all home. I thought I’d surprise Linda by showing up home early. I was the one with the surprise of my life. I knew something was up when I walked in. Linda was sitting on the couch and shed obviously been crying. I asked, and she told me she’d been having an affair with our friend Steve. I left on the spot. In hindsight, I should’ve taken Ralphie with me. But I just wanted to get out of there. Instead, she went down to the courts the next day and filed for custody. It took five months to settle this stupid custody mess. And in the meanwhile, I’ve spent my entire savings. $23,000 cash. I think the lawyer might have done me dirtier than my ex in some ways.

I had just started a new job, so I had to sell a majority of my belongings and dip into my saving to pay for representation. In the process, given I had to take time off from my new job, I wound up being let go even though I was told by my supervisor that it was okay for me to take time off from work so soon given the importance of the situation. I knew I wouldn't be able to keep up with my overly expensive rent, so I wound up breaking my lease early and living in an Airbnb for a month thanks to my savings. This gave me time to look for a new job and actually apartment to start over in. I wound up losing the custody battle in the process because I could not longer afford to pay my attorney. If it wasn't for the vast majority of online jobs available today and the fact that I didn't sell one of my laptop computers, I probably would've been out on the street considering everyone in my family has passed, and a majority of my close friends now live on the other side of or outside the country. Needless to say this has been an eye opening experiencing, and it just goes to show you that life is so unpredictable. Here I was comfortable in my careen path only to have an unforeseeable event turn entire life upside down. I've always been a humble person, but when you go from eating at five-star restaurants daily, to eating free Dunkin' Donuts for a month straight it really makes you realize what's really important in life. All and all this experience has taught me a lot. Not to be jaded, but to really cherish and be thankful for the little things that you do have (like your health) instead of taking things like a hot shower or clean water for granted. I honestly don't know where this journey will take me next, but I'm honestly thankful that I at least have a roof over my head while I fight to get my life back to what it was. ""Just because you've found yourself in the gutter, that doesn't mean you have to stay there."" I once remember my grandfather saying those words to me when I was a child... And they've been my motivation throughout this entire experience.

It started early in the day, and my parents came by and picked me up at my house.  Everyone was in a very somber mood, but it was sunny and quite warm.  We drove out to a church about thirty minutes away near where my mom grew up, and while driving I couldn't help but think back to all the good memories I had with my cousin.  She was always so happy and nice and just fun to be around.  But now, that was all gone, and all I had were the memories that were going over in my mind. Arriving at the church and seeing all of my family, it was hard.  It was just so sad, all of it.  Seeing my aunt was the hardest part I think, but I knew then that she was strong and was going to be able to get past this. My uncle is an ordained pastor, so he was able to help with the service and I think that helped ease some of the pain.  After the service we all went to the cemetery and gathered up on the hill in the shade.  Seeing the final resting place really hit me hard, I started to cry much harder than I had been all day at that point.  All of the memories and the final shock to my brain that she was never coming back, made me very sad, and made me miss her dearly.  We then all met at a local place where they served a late lunch and we had some drinks.  It was good to see so many of my family, but at the same time, so sad, because I thought that we shouldn't be seeing each other, at least not for this reason.  I didn't really know how to feel when we left and I made it back home.  I was deeply saddened, and just thought of how my aunt, uncle, and cousins felt.  I know that life had changed for them forever, and now life was starting again without their dear one, and that hurt me again.  But my family is strong, and stronger together, and I know we will get through this like we will any other tragedy that comes our way.",4,"My cousin recently passed away due to brain cancer.

Immediately she caught my attention since I was very attracted to her, but I simply went back to my work once a moment or two had passed. I was writing an email to a coworker when she walked by again. I looked out of the corner of my eye to see that she was heading toward the break room. I decided that the email could wait so I decided to mosey on over to the break room myself to get a cup of coffee, and if she so happened to be in there then that would be just great. I walk in and notice her standing at the coffee machine pouring herself a cup. I walk up and wait for her to be done when she goes to get a packet of sugar to add to her coffee when she notices the container is empty. She doesn't seem to know where the extras are stored so I open up and tell her that the spare sugar packets are stored in the cabinet above the sink. She thanks me and walks over to the previously mentioned cabinet. She thanks me and introduces herself as Pam, and I nod my head and tell her my name is Tim. As I pour myself a cup of coffee, I remark that I haven't seen her around the office before and ask if she just started working here. She responds that she is actually just here for the week as she is running a training seminar for people in the accounting department. I feel slightly relieved by this since that means if something does happen between us it won't be an awkward office romance, but at the same time I was a bit upset because she was only here for a week. I grab myself a cookie and offer her one to go with the coffee she is drinking. She accepts. Seeing as how it's Thursday and she will be done with her training seminar tomorrow, I decide to go for broke and do something I normally never do. I just straight up ask her if she would like to grab some dinner sometime with me. She smiles and gives me her phone number and tells me to text her later so we can work something out. I add her number and smile and tell her I should probably get back to work, but if she needs any more help finding other condiments to come find me at my desk and I'll be happy to help. She laughs and says she will be looking for my text. I go back to my desk and resume writing the email, but this time in a much better mood.",2,"Meeting the love of my life for the first time.

I was working on a ladder painting my house. After a long afternoon of painting, I was feeling a bit tired and began to descend the ladder. I missed a rung on the ladder and fell about 9 feet. When I hit the ground, I felt incredible pain in my left leg. After standing up and trying to walk, I couldn't put any pressure on my leg and the pain was almost overwhelming. Luckily, my wife was home at the time and drove me to the hospital. After waiting for over an hour, I was finally seen by a doctor in the emergency room.  The doctor began the examination by moving my leg and I nearly screamed from the pain. He gave my a shot filled with pain medication of some kind and sent me for a x-ray.

Luckily, we did not encounter any delays and we arrived in plenty of time.  I had booked a transfer from the airport to the Pier, and the bus driver gave us a tour on the way.

It had been hours since we had any real food and we were not able to go to our rooms yet.  We walked around a bit and then finally went to our cabin.   Our vacation was finally starting! The days were filled with food, scenery, movies, casinos, shows and some land excursions.  Exploring different parts of the ship kept us very busy.   The most memorable part of the cruise was when we went into Glacier Bay - the scenery was breathtaking!  We saw the glacier break apart into the water a few times, once was a large break.

We found our room, dropped off some stuff and then went to get some food.  They were serving burgers and fries at one of the eateries.  We waited in line, there were a lot of people.  The food was not great but we figured it was due to the number of people being served and they were rushing to serve as many as possible.  The food throughout the cruise was hit and miss...but mostly very good.  At least, if we did not like something, we could go back and get something else.

My grandparents were completely taken by surprise and were very touched by this event. It was a wonderful time for me too. I learned things about their lives that I did not know, some of them significant. When I learned how they had to abandon the family farm because of the dust storms and travel to California with all their possessions with two little children and almost no money. The hardships they endured made me think about how blessed my life has been. It is also very heart warming that they ended up living on the Pacific Ocean south of Santa Cruz where they eventually bought their own property with the money they earned from picking fruit in the Santa Clara Valley.       During the party my cousin Sarah offered to come live with them to help them get treatment to combat their advancing age. What a nice thing to do. It will be a win win for all, because Sarah will be going to school just 10 miles from where my grandparents live. Life is simply wonderful to be part of such a close knit extended family. I really appreciate what Sarah will be doing. My grandparents were very receptive to the idea. This way they will be able to stay in their home.

However, when I reached the location of the party, I came to realize that it was more of a surprise party for them, and all of my aunts and uncles had traveled to attend! I was shocked to see so many family members there, and they were all excited to see me. With the festivities commenced, I went to go talk to some of my cousins that had all traveled a decent distance to be there. I learned that one of my cousins was going to move closer to my grandparents since they needed more immediate help (my grandpa was struggling with Alzheimer's).  He told me that my grandparents had shown lots of signs of needing help and offered to be a help when a family council was called with all my aunts and uncles. That was definitely a surprisingly development! The party itself was great and well planned. There was a slideshow to help everyone remember all the awesome moments of my grandparents lives and what they had done for the world. They showed that my grandpa used to serve in the marines and would have to leave for long stretches of time to fulfill those assignments. Most surprisingly, they had a scavenger hunt prepared that had some of the littler children go around the house and ""discover"" hidden clues that revealed more about my grandparent's lives. They were thrilled to participate and added to the fun of the party. After all was said and done, the family did a great job of preparing the party and showing my grandparents that they care. There was a lot of work that needed to get done with their advancing age, but it was great to participate and see so many familiar faces.",2,There was a sort of surprise party for my grandparent's 50th wedding anniversary.

One of the jobs seemed like an ideal fit, no more commute to the large city, great benefits and I really enjoyed the interview.  I had been referred to this one by a friend. I decided to be extra pursuant of that position and requested a follow up interview via phone myself, and I was thrilled when they told me they had planned to call me.  At the second interview I met many more of the staff and they seemed very impressed with my skill set. Today I let my manager and coworkers know that I was resigning, and leaving the company in 2 weeks.  Some of my coworkers where beside themselves.  I found it hard to say goodbye.  A couple of them were very emotional.  Cleaning out my office will be difficult. However, we have scheduled a going away get together at the local pub on my last day and I look forward to that.

I started to look for a new job after co-worker left and make my job much more stressful.  It was not an easy decision to have a job search when I worked in the same place for close to 12 years.  I started out with aggregate job posting site Indeed.  I found out with their email notification it is very helpful for a job seeker.  This job searching is not an easy process to customize my cover letter and resume for individual job.  I applied over 10 jobs and have 1 phone interview and another with an in-person interview in this 2 months period.  I went for the in-person interview job and find out I have experiences with the position.  I was excited to learn that I got one of the job with a much higher pay than what I am earning.  I also will have less stress on certain part of the job compared to what I am working as.  I will be starting the new job in about a week.  I hope things will be alright.  I feel anxious and excited at the same time.  It is partly because I was in the same position for close to 12 years in the same company and now I will have to adjust to a new routine.  Some of my coworkers where I am working in now are very sad about my leaving.,1,This is about my job searching experiences for the past 2 months.

We hiked a lot.,"A few weeks ago, my wife and I headed to Washington state to go hiking in the mountains. As we had never been there before, we were both very excited about the vacation. We packed up the car with our camping gear, put the dog in a kennel and we were off. We arrived in Washington after about 15 hours of non-stop driving. When we arrived in Seattle, the first thing we saw was Mt. Rainier. My wife and I laughed because it reminded us of our first date together in college. We ended up going to a frat party, where they were drinking Rainier beer. It had a drawing of Rainier on the logo. Anyway, when we arrived at the campground, we were absolutely struck by how beautiful the national park was. We were going to be hiking a very long trail the next day, so we quickly set up the tent and got our campsite squared away. My wife, who hadn't been camping very often, was a little bit skittish about the signs we had seen warning of bears. Every time a twig snapped or the wind blew our tent flaps against the tent walls, she started in fright. Eventually, we both drifted off to sleep after the long drive. The next morning, we secured our campsite and headed off to begin our 5 mile hike. We packed food and water and started up the trail. There were dark clouds in the horizon, and I commented that we might be in for rain. But my wife thought it'd be okay to continue. It never did rain and we had a wonderful hike. Overall, our first vacation to Washington state was a huge success and we look forward to returning some day.",2,My wife and I took a vacation to Washington state.

We weren't going to stay in Seattle, but really get out in the wilderness for this vacation. So we drove out to Washington and made our way out into the back country. We wanted to first go hiking and camping at Olympic National park. We were hoping the weather would be nice and that we wouldn't have any trouble. The weather did turn out nice and we made our way hiking into the park. There were many interesting paths around the park and we got to see many amazing sites. The mountains, forests, streams and odd bit of wildlife all added to how awed we were by it all. We were having such a good time, instead of moving off toward other parks, we spent an extra day at the park. Once we had packed up our camping gear we went on with the rest of the trip. We left to do the other half of our trip plan, which was mostly driving and exploring. We drive around the state seeing all that we could see and remaining floored by the beauty. Unfortunately the weather turned to rain during this part of our trip, but we powered through. We wish that we could have had more time out there, but we had to come home. It ended up being one of our best trips.",1,My wife and I took a vacation to Washington state.

We stayed at Rockwood Farm which is a log mansion - something I didn't know existed.  On our arrival in Seattle, we visited a few shops and had some coffee at the Starbucks Roastery before heading to our room in Snoqualmie.  Being from Florida, we were amazed by the surroundings since Washington is basically the opposite of Florida.  I think the most memorable thing was the view of Mt. Rainier while we were on the ferry on our way to Poulsbo.  It looked almost like a moon in the sky.  While in Poulsbo, we attended a beer tasting at the Kiana Lodge.  Another cool thing we saw was the naval base in Everett.  A running theme of the trip was how big everything was.  Whether it was battleships, mountains, trees, or just buildings, everything seemed huge compared to Florida.  Also of note was the weather.  That area is famous for being rainy and cold, but the whole time we were there the weather was beautiful.

We stayed in Snoqualmie, which is about an hour East of Seattle.  We rented a convertible Mustang, which was really fun because the weather was beautiful and having the top down made it feel like we were more a part of the magnificent scenery.  In fact, we never saw a single drop of Washington's famous rain during the four days we were there.  We even only got clouds for part of one day.  We stayed at a place called Rockwood Farm, which has ""Washington's most liked front gate on Instagram"", which sounds dumb, but the driveway really is something special to see.  The farm isn't really so much a farm as it is a log mansion sitting on several acres of land on the North Fork Snoqualmie river.  There was a playground on the property for kids.  Also, there was a heard of  elk that roamed the grounds and weren't particularly bothered by people.   Mt. Si loomed in the background.

I was freaking out pretty hard when it dawned on me that hey, I was marrying the girl of my dreams. The way we had met was spectacular, and totally happenstance. We had both been at a Spiritual guidance gathering at a retreat in the woods, and from the moment I saw her I knew that I needed to talk to her. I approached her with a soft smile on my face and we caught eyes, and I could immediately tell that she was the one. Now here we are, two and half years later, and I'm struggling with my damn tie and sweating and just overall a nervous wreck. Like I said, I realized that this is the girl of my dream, and the way we met was just serendipitous. I waited at the altar with a lump in my throat, waiting for her beautiful face to be led down the aisle by her Father. When that moment arrived, I was starstruck, I damn near fell over due to how beautiful she actually was, I hadn't actually seen her in about three days, due to the bachelorette party, and of course the tradition of the groom not seeing the bride before this moment on their wedding day. As soon as she reached the altar, I felt all the panick in my heart dissolve. We smiled at eachother and took one anothers hands as we looked towards the priest to begin the ceremony. I couldn't wait to make her mine, to bring her into my life as my wife, and I knew she felt the same way. It was absolutely lovely, and everything I could have expected and more. The reception was a blast as well, plenty of people laughing and telling happy stories of the two of us, and wishing us an absolutely blissful life together. That being said, I think we can leave the honeymoon out of this, because that might get a little racy, even for you diary. When we arrived home from the honeymoon, and I had to return to work, it was with great disdain that I left my new bride home alone, though I knew I would be back to see her in only eight short hours. I made haste to the office to begin my day and effectively my new life. When I walked into the office, I was immediately called into my supervisors office and I thought trouble immediately, only to be relieved that there was no trouble at all. In fact, it had been a promotion waiting for me for all of my diligent work and loyalty to the company. Could this get any better? I mean, I have had some pretty damn good luck all things considered, but is it really luck? Or is it this result of my hard work, patience and determination in succeeding in this life?

He really enjoys the independance of living on his own and making decisions for himself.  Recently, I have had to have very stern conversations with him regarding his spending habits and budget.  He has not been very disciplined when it comes to spending money, and as a results is over his bduget for the year.  The significance is this threatens his ability to do certain activities like trips to other countries in the future.  He is eating into his ""travel money"" for trivial expenses like fast food and drinks at a local bar. I don't enjoy lecturing him about this, but I feel I have to step in before this becomes a bigger problem.  I want him to embrace the fact he is able to live his own life.  However, if he cannot make mature decisions, and those decisions could impact the rest of his time overseas, I must act. He has been reluctant to discuss the problem and seems more interested in just ignoring the situation (and me).  He tells me he is aware of what is happening and willing to accept the consequences and act accordingly.  I think this is just him telling me what he thinks I want to hear.  I also do not think he truly understands the impact of being in a foreign country with little to no money if he exhausts his savings. Even though my getting involved is putting a damper on his enjoyment in the near tem, I expect in the long run he will be happy.  Once he is able to see the bigger picture of what saving (vs. spending) allows him to do, I believe he will be thankful he changed his spending habits.",1,"My son just left to spend his freshman year of college in Italy.

That expectation took on a new twist when he was accepted at a school that had a program allowing freshman student to apply to spend their entire first college year studying in Italy.  He was thrilled when he was accepted in to the program, and I was happy and proud.  However I was also nervous and sad. While I am exicted for him and the opportuniy he has in front of him over the next year, it still hurts to think of him being so far away.  The idea of ""losing"" someone I am used to seeing every day, that I won't be able to help him if he gets sick or hurt, hat we won't be able to take a walk together, or throw a ball, or share a soda, or just talk... leaves me with an empty feeling inside.  Sure we will text and email, and (hopefully) speak on the phone several times each week, but it is not the same. Should I feel guilty over being sad instead of happy for him?  In truth, I feel both.  I am proud to see him take another step towards growing up and becoming his own man... but I also miss my little boy.",4,"My son just left to spend his freshman year of college in Italy.

She's relapsed a few times but is doing better now.,"He's the love of my life and a great man, but the drugs are the greatest source of pain in my life. I am not sure what exactly caused him to pick up the habit but I do know he had a rough childhood. One day I walked into the garage and saw that he had completely rearranged it and I noticed a small glass pipe on one of the tables. I had never seen this type of pipe before but I did notice the residue built up inside. I confronted him about this and he admitted that he had smoked some earlier in the day and started cleaning up the garage. I asked him how long he had been using and he said he started recently. I had noticed some changes in his behavior recently. He started to stay up later and later at night. At times I would wake up in the morning and he was still awake. I thought he was stressed out because of work or that he needed to catch up on an assignment but I did not think much of it. Once he admitted to smoking meth I told him he needed to get help. This is a slippery slope and I didn't want it to get to an extreme point. This was 5 years ago. He went to rehab for a few months and everything seemed fine. He came back and attended some NA meetings and met some people that could help him out with his problems. Then he started acting odd again. He came home at odd hours of the night and when I confronted him, he became very defensive and refused to answer my questions. Then the arrest came. As a result of him going to rehab he lost his job. I had to pick up two shifts in order to make ends meet. When he came back he had a hard time holding a job. He bounced around from job to job until he met up with some people at NA who set him up with a decent job at a local fast food restaurant. He had been working there for 3 years and then he had the bright idea of stealing some money from the register to feed his habit. Three months ago, the manager confronted him about this, and he was arrested that very same day. I love him with all my heart but I can't stay with him if he relapses again, because next time I don't know what he will do.",3,My husband relapsed into active meth addiction.

We fight all the time and as much as I try, I can't make him happy or help him with his anger.  He has returned to meth one time since he's been out and it was terrible to watch.  He had full-on delusions and wanted to argue you with me over scientific principles that were non-existent.  He claimed that all plants have psychedelic properties and that he could make DMT out of the mimosa trees that grow near our house.  I found him passed out at the base of a poor tree that had been hacked halfway out of the ground with a garden trowel.  He seems to be doing better and has gotten into an outpatient treatment program in the last week.   I fear he has some psychological issues that need medication, but I dare not say anything about it to him.  Luckily, I work from home and can monitor him while he's here.  I moved after his arrest to a more rural area to avoid the drug culture that our old neighborhood was immersed in.  As for myself, I have no desire to use drugs, other than maybe some pot now and then to relax.  I feel like there are so many other people that suffer from addiction and there are no real resources to help them, save meetings and for-profit rehabs.  I have started a non-profit application so that people might be able to get to meetings and appointments.  It seems that people on drugs have no transportation to get to the help that they so desperately need.  Watching the man that I love devolve into an angry crazy caricature is heartbreaking to say the least.  He was a beautiful, intelligent, thoughtful, playful, poetic soul when I married him and drugs have taken that man away and left me with a shell.  I hope and pray that he can come back to his former self and I will use all my resources to make that happen.",4,My husband relapsed into active meth addiction.

He had been clean for 5 years at that point.  He cheated on me with other women, he stole our bill money for drugs, and became a stranger in my soulmates body.  I realized that I had to get out of the situation, he wasn't going to stop on his own.  I began working online so I could keep an eye on the house.  One afternoon, my husband had been gone all day, I presumed he was stealing to support his habit.  All of the sudden, I saw the car he left in race past the house with police cars in pursuit.  A short time later, he tore into the driveway, with the car engine on fire, and ran in the house and into the back bedroom.  When the police knocked on the door, I was too scared to open it.  A few minutes later, they broke the window and I told them I was unarmed and coming out.  There were at least 15 police cars surrounding our street.  I was in shock and did not know how to deal.  They didn't ask me anything, they knew about the drugs and knew they weren't mine.  I lost my love that day.  The innocence of my perceived true love had forever been shattered.  It's been three months, he's been in jail since the end of June.  I still don't know what will happen to my marriage.  I don't know if anyone can come back from that.

This resort was located on the beach and had full service amenities. On the day of her birthday we decided to take it easy and swim by the pool. We ordered breakfast and mimosa's and the staff brought it to us. The meal consisted of poached eggs, hashbrowns, biscuits, and gravy. They even brought us a fresh bowl of fruit. We decided to take a walk after we ate and picked up shells on the beach. Just seeing her smile made me happy. That afternoon we decided to have a short nap before the real fun began. She made sure to fix her hair and make-up for our big night out. Her dress was, as blue as, the ocean and made her eye's shine. I decided on a nice blue polo shirt and a pair of cargo shorts. Around 5 we departed our room for dinner at the resort's restaurant. The atmosphere was serene and romantic. I handed my wife her gift and when she opened up the box tears fell from her eyes. It was a special bracelet with our children's birthstones. She has been such a great wife and mother that the gift seem a little cheap. We ordered our food which consisted of crab legs, salad, and clam chowder. We wanted it to be a light meal since we were heading the beach club for a night of drinking and dancing. The servers surprised her at the end of dinner with a big slice of chocolate cake and sang happy birthday. Her face seemed to turn red as they danced around the table. After paying the bill we jumped in a taxi and went out to dance. Carlos was a small dance club on the south side of the resort. We were able to get our own VIP table and they brought us a bucket of champagne. I popped the cork with great pleasure and made a toast to my wife in her honor.",1,"It was my wife's birthday at an all inclusive resort. We had a blast there.

It was a Sandals resort and everything was included such as drinks, food, and sleeping arrangements. We went for her birthday because she had never been out of the country and always wanted to. On the first day, we decided to just relax a bit and drink on the beach. It was a lot of fun because we could just talk together. I have never been able to spend that much alone time with my wife because we are constantly hanging out with our children. It was very nice to be able to get away. As the vacation went on we decided we wanted to do some sort of physical activity. We did a high ropes course right off the beach that made me a bit nervous, but that my wife loved it. I don't like heights that much and many objects were swinging at a high height. I was able to jump from space to space, but often would fall and dangle from the top. We also decided to go on a quick cruise that took us out at sunset to watch some dolphins swimming in the ocean. The sunset was absolutely beautiful and we didn't see many dolphins, but the company from being next to my wife was the best. Almost every night we would go dancing too. There was a bar that had a huge dance floor and lots of people would come out and we would all just dance together and chill. It was great to be with my wife, but also be surrounded by other people. We didn't want this vacation to end, but eventually we had to leave and return to our kids so we had to.

At first she was skeptical but then she said she enjoyed the food and how it was set up. We then went to to the pool area where there was a snack and drink bar with all you can eat snacks as well. We enjoyed our time there and swimming there was a blast. Afterwards we went to the night entertainment. It was there that we saw the different shows for kids and grown ups.

I also enjoyed the open bars. I had alot of different cocktails that I didn't know about before. I got to fill my satisfaction in that area.

Traveling on the highways makes me nervous because of all the unexpected stresses that can happen but I set that aside and bought the tickets.  In anticipation of some stresses I tried to mitigate that by purchasing the special up close and determined parking, and a fast pass so I wouldn't have to wait in line.  I even surprised myself by driving the whole way to the city.  I drove to the otherskirts of the city to a place we planned to eat.  From there things got stressful because parking was difficult, and it was a busy pedestrian area.  The parking meters wouldn't work and the person I was with was aggravated that I didn't just want to park there anyway.  I was worried about being towed in a city that wasn't mine, shortly before this thing I wanted to do.  We ended up getting a new parking spot but that was strike one.  After that we found out way to the venue okay and parked relatively easily.  It was a pleasant day, not too hot, and it was nice to find the fast pass line to be not very long.  Then when we arrived for the outdoor concert we were given nice little lawn chairs to sit in.  We sat our chairs directly behind the back railing of the front standing room area.  We had a good view and the closest area you could sit on with the lawn chairs.  I started to feel more relaxed and ventured off on my own to buy a t-shirt while my partner saved our spot.  Unbeknownst to me, my partner was very uncomfortable in the little chairs and started to have negative feelings about the situation they found themselves in.  When I returned and mentioned I saw they were selling beers, my partner snapped at me in front of other people, why I hadn't gotten them one, then got up in a huff to go do it themselves.  I had to try to ignore that comment for the sake of appearances and to try not to ruin my night as I was essentially stuck here.  The rest of the evening proceeded find until the band came one and almost immediately what one would call an obnoxious frat boy took up the space directly in front of me, and the people next to me.  He was annoying for 90% of the concert.  The concert itself, was great.  The band put on an absolutely great show, the evening was pleasant, it was an outdoor venue, and it wasn't too hot.

I don't really enjoy travel due to the traffic and stress but decided that I would go to see my favorite band.  I immediately purchased the tickets when I was able to get them on presale and I also purchased special parking.  As the day of the concert slowly approached I became anxious about the travel.  I started thinking that maybe I should just sell the tickets since it was  a sold out show.  In the end, I decided against it.  On the day of the concert I was the one to drive the whole way there, including to a restaurant in the heart of the city.  I was pleased I'd made it that far without a large amount of stress. From the restaurant my partner drove us to the concert.  We had fast pass so got inside with a shorter line.  It was a pleasant day for an outdoor concert and we even had lawn chairs provided by the venue.  The concert and evening was better than expected even though my partner was cranky about their seating arrangement.  It was a wonderful night in a good setting, even though the 22 year old in front of me was drunk and obnoxious the whole concert.  The group I was going to see surpassed how I thought they would perform live.  Even my partner who didn't really like or dislike the band commented on what a good show it was.  Even now reminiscing I'm pleased I changed my mind and went. And looking back, even though we got unnecessarily lost on the way home and fought regarding that, (when I wasn't driving), the concert itself was worth it.",1,Person embarks on possibly stressful trip into the city to see favorite band before chance slips away.,90.0,0.02284800074994564,,0.024879461328322684,0.021819447972067044,0.02808265222633696,0.02694591462461497,,0.002031460578377043,-0.0010285527778785969,0.005234651476391319,0.004097913874669328,293,17,4.242320819112628,0.590443686006826,30,17.235294117647058,2,26,31,1,0

We all thought it would be incredible if our children would later in life go on to the same college and carry on this cycle.  On our last night there, we decided to bury a time capsule to dig up in 10 years.  Our children also placed items in the capsule and they made their own pact to stay in touch.  Even before we left, they were trading email addresses, phone numbers, and friending each other on facebook.  It was all surreal.  I wouldn't change a thing.

We gathered at the lake in Kentucky where we meet every May.  We spent three days fishing, boating, and socializing.  It was great to hear from old friends who we do not see often anymore.  All of the adults were very close in college, but have drifted apart in the recent years moving to different states. It was important to me because while I enjoy meeting with my two best friends from college, our families have now started to grow closer as well.  Each family has two children, and I enjoyed seeing my daughters become closer friends with the other children.  The children planned their own games, enjoyed swimming in the lake, and created a rope-swing off of the dock.  The most meaningful moments to me were seeing our children develop a similar friendship to what I had with the two other Dads who were present that weekend. The children wanted to keep in contact upon leaving, which has not happened before.  They planned to ""borrow"" phones from their parents so that they could text and call each other throughout the summer.  They even planned another trip for the three families to an amusement part later this fall. The children are now growing old enough that they can experience lake activities without the adults, giving us more time for reflection and fun.  The fact the the weekend hit a milestone birthday for me this year was largely a coincidence, but it worked out perfectly as a time to reflect on four decades and anticipate (hopefully) many more.  It is great ot know that some friendships span multiple generations.",2,"I spend my 40th birthday at a lakehouse in Kentucky.  MY two best friends from college were there, along with their families.

Unfortunately, we had no juice in the house at all that I could drink. I went looking for cookies in the cabinets but once again I could not find any. I was starting to panic at this point. There was no one else in the house that could help me if I blacked out. I could seriously die. I finally remembered that I would occasionally keep a candy bar in my bag just for such an occasion. Rushing to the bedroom, I hoped against hope that I had not eaten it already and it was still there. Luckily, it was. I quickly scarfed down the chocolate bar, savoring every bite as best I could.

If my blood sugar is too high, I will need to take insulin to bring it down.  Otherwise, I can get extremely sick.  If my blood sugar is too low, I need to eat food and drink with carbohydrates in order to raise my blood sugar.  If I don't treat my low blood sugar quickly, I can have a seizure which can lead to my death.  One Saturday afternoon several months ago, I began to prepare my dinner.  I was going to eat two chickens breasts and a cup of brown rice.  In order to prevent blood sugar spikes, I need to take my insulin around 30 minutes before I eat.  On this day, I took around 10 units of insulin in order to cover my rice.  The food took around 30 minutes to prepare and it smelled delicious.  I was very eager to eat try out the chicken breasts due to a new recipe I used so I ate both of the chicken breasts first.  The chicken was absolutely delicious.  However, I had become uncomfortably full.  I was full to the point where I felt like I needed to vomit.  Unfortunately, at this time my insulin was starting to kick in which dragged my blood sugars down to dangerously low levels.  Chicken doesn't have any carbohydrates in them so they wouldn't have prevented my blood sugars from dropping.  I needed to eat the rice, but I couldn't because I felt like I was going to vomit.  My strength started to go and my body started to spasm.  It was harder for me to think clearly due to my low blood sugar.  I knew I needed something light that had a lot of carbohydrates to bring up my sugar quick.  Through my haze, I remember I had Gatorade Energy Gels.  I typically used these gels when I exercise because they have a lot of carbohydrates in them.  I tore the gels out of their packets and let them sit under my tongue to dissolve.  After sitting and eating the gels, it took about 25 minutes for my blood sugar to get back up to a safe level.  I remember sitting on the floor of my living room, drenched in sweat, and feeling relief that I made it through the ordeal.",3,"A Type 1 Diabetic prepares to sit down and eat dinner on a typical Saturday afternoon.

Type 1 Diabetes is when the autoimmune system attacks the pancreas and destroys the pancreas' ability to regulate blood sugar.  Due to this, a Type 1 Diabetic has to inject insulin everyday in order to live.  Unfortunately, while you can do a good job managing your blood sugars using insulin, you simply can't compare to a fully functioning pancreas and problems will occur as a result.  In May, I was at home on a Saturday cooking dinner.  I was having brown rice and baked chicken breasts.   Due to the carbohydrates that are in rice, I had to take insulin in order for my body to process the brown rice.  I took my insulin around 20 minutes before I ate.   I planned to eat a lot(for me) of brown rice that evening so I took a much larger than normal dose of insulin.  After I prepared my food, I sat down and began to eat my chicken breasts first.  I tried a special barbecue sauce on the chicken breasts and they tasted wonderful.   I had no problems devouring the chicken breasts.  After I finished the chicken breast, I started to eat the brown rice.  However, I started to feel extremely and uncomfortably full to the point where I became nauseated.   Unfortunately, at that time the insulin that I took for the brown rice started to kick in some my blood sugar dropped down to dangerously low levels.  I tried to eat the rice to get my blood sugar back up, but I was so full that I couldn't do it.  At that time, the effects of low blood sugar were kicking in.  I was sweating heavily and shaking.  I had trouble moving.  My ability to think and problem solve took a huge hit.  I was slowly wandering around my apartment looking for something that I could eat that wouldn't cause me to vomit which would make it even harder to get my blood sugar back up.  That's when I found some Powerbar Energy Gels that I use when I exercise.  They weren't heavy on your stomach and they have a lot of carbohydrates which would counteract the insulin.  I downed a few packets of the gels and in 20-25 minutes I started to feel better.  I had survived, but it is a situation that still scares me to this day.",4,"A Type 1 Diabetic prepares to sit down and eat dinner on a typical Saturday afternoon.

I was getting desperate and was starting to sell my personal items that I really cherished. When my friend found out what was happening he offered to lend me his work van and get me a job where he worked. He bought all the supplies I would need to start the job, gave me money for gas, and even bought my meals for a few weeks. I had never done anything like this for him. It really shocked me how willing he was to help me, nobody had offered anything like this to me before. He really helped me out and allowed me to use the money I made on all the bills I had backed up. If it wasn't for his kindness I would have been without a place to live or a way to continue to live there. He never asked for anything back either, he jut wanted me to get back on to my feet. He did all the training himself so I wouldn't feel uncomfortable with somebody I didn't know. He even went to bat for me with the boss when they tried to take advantage of me because I was the new worker. Even when I got injured on the job he made sure that they treated me right and that I got the treatment that I needed. When I finally saved up money and got my bills paid down I offered to start paying him for some of the things he did. He just told me to keep it and make sure I don't get in that situation again.

In addition, some of the requirements of that task have changed in the process. Feeding and making sure my daughter didn't hurt herself were essential tasks when she was a toddler, but now in grade school the expectations of motherhood have shifted.

I'm excited to start getting into science projects and fun activities she gets to take home with her. I hope to help her and continue to show her the value of education and learning.

I was surprised by how he handled my rejection well enough, but also how I was even able to accept it afterwards. I guess I'm realizing a part of myself that lacks the empathy that I wish I had. So, running through events quickly in my head, I probably was thinking about the significance or connection I had to the event but instead should have been thinking about how my friend would feel about my attendance. I think this event gave me a good perspective on what I am and what I think I should become. I need to be able to hold the people that I care for, and the people that care for me, closer than I do.

I have always made time and I'm not much of a corporate type of guy.,"At the time I was working with Corporate Vestus Enterprises. I was working a lot of hours and flying around all over the place. Now obviously, this can often come at odds with family and friend matters, it becomes increasingly difficult to have a personal life with people other than co-workers. Anyways, so yet again I was seeing some issues regarding my business schedule and how I could make time for family. I felt really bad, prior to working for this company my niece and I were extremely close. In fact, I practically raised her myself when her parents were not around to handle matters (things were pretty tight with them so they had to work a lot). I finally had made up my mind and firmly resolved I could not miss this. So I spoke with some of my co-workers and really, REALLY had to twist their arms about it. I didn't want to bring it up with upper-management because I knew they would react with cold disregard. In this company, your company is your personal life and if you aren't cut out for this, the door is right there. So I convinced my co-workers to cover this one project for me, it was not easy. I had to really sweeten the deal, I told each of them I would cover twice as many projects for them (if and when they needed it).

Since she was a little baby i was waiting for this moment, because she has a personality that makes me feel like I have my sister back when she was young. That is regarding because for several reasons my sister is not longer along with us, and she is like the memory we have about my sister. Now why that date was so important for me? Well, I am no exactly in my home country. I am living abroad because of my career, but for that date I wanted to jump from my place to her place, just because i cannot miss that once in a life event for my niece. I overpay a flight ticket, i layover for about 12 hours ins another country, i got event sick because of the meal, but you know what?, i don't regret at all. At the end of the day i saw her face, i saw how happy she was in her party celebration, and also she was happy to see me there. I could dance with my little niece, which is such my little baby as well , and i will remember that for the rest of my life. I said to her that when i was in the airplane, i saw her mother in the sky, she told me to carry her, and said i love you in behave of her. My niece was so happy, she hug me and i whisper: your mother is so proud of you honey. I am pretty sure my sister was also dancing in the heaven.

We went to King's Island. My son is five, but large for his age (big enough to go on every ride in the ""Kiddie"" part of the park), but he has a developmental disorder, with issues predominantly centered around attention and language.  This has given him some social delays as well - and so often in exciting places (like an amusement park) it can be tough to maintain his attention on something that I want him focused on.   Also, there are times when he doesn't have the language to communicate his needs or express what he's thinking about.   Despite this, he's adventurous and likes to try new things, so going to an amusement park is sort of ""up his alley"" but also a type of situation that can give me anxiety due to the language and attention challenges. This trip was amazing.  My son was completely excited and had the time of his life.  We had worked on the word ""brave"" and he continued to use this term to describe himself at the park.  He'd go up to one of the kiddie rides and express that he was going to be brave and then I'd watch him just rise to the moment.  I'll be honest, I'm getting emotional just remembering the look on his face when he was utterly terrified of a ride, wanted to be on it, and didn't want me to ride it with him.  He told me he was going to be ""Brave"" and the determination and maturity as he faced his fear, and handled it was amazing.   And beyond that, the pride he had when he got off that little ride fills my heart.  There were some language difficulties, when I was asking him about some of the adult rides, ""What do you think of that one?  That looks big! That looks scary.""  He clearly misunderstood my intentions and got into a panic, becoming really scared and shouting ""I don't want to ride it!""    He calmed down when my wife explained that she wasn't going to make him get on the big rides.   Although, honestly, he gave me a skeptical look as if to say, ""You won't Mom, but I dunno about Dad...."" He was amazing, and it was a fantastic experience this summer.  It helped us see how far he had come in his development and with his language use.",1,"My wife and I took our young son with developmental delays to an amusement park, where he had the time of his life.

I'm sure you've seen those roadside attractions where you can have those old-timey type photos taken. You dress up in old clothes. Sometimes you're cops and robbers or sometimes you're barmaids. Things like that. We got the whole family to take on in Western clothes. It was amazing and definitely an experience. I keep the picture on my mantle in a nice frame.

My wife and I had talked for years of visiting the Island.  Now off we went. The fairy ride over was a little rough I was concerned because my wife did not like boats. The first thing I noticed about the Island was it smelled of horse crap.  The next I noticed was the people.  There were bicycles whipping between the horses and the people.  The first thing we did was get tickets to the butterfly house. Then we trekked to the top of a huge hill to see the Fort.  After the Fort the butterfly house. There were thousands of live Butterflies everywhere. After this we were both tired, only there for and hour and are legs felt like rubber. Fate was with us and we existed the house there was a horse taxi right there. So off to the Grand Hotel. A nice place but disappointing in the fact they charge people ten dollars just to walk on the grounds. Off to eat after that then shopping. My wife surprised me by not buying much of anything until we reached a shop that took Western Picture of you dressed in Western garb. This was something she always wanted. So I dressed up as a cowboy and she as a bar wench and we had our picture. This thrilled her which thrilled me as well. All in all the trip will be something we always remember.

It became so common for me, that I never even expected to win. This never discouraged me from trying however, in fact, if anything, it took the pressure off of attempting things for me, because I felt like I already knew the outcome. So, when I saw the advertisement for a local recreational baseball league, I thought, why not? I showed up assuming I wouldn't get chosen for the team anyway, seeing as how I have on real athletic abilities, but to my surprise, everyone else on the team was just as bad as I was! I made the team and found that I really connected with all the other players. We all seemed to have similar pasts. We were all used to being losers. None of us expected to make the team, and we all had no illusions of winning anything. It was just for fun. Having met such a like minded group was unusual and exciting for all of us.  Before we knew it, we were meeting up to practice as much as we could, just because we enjoyed the company of one another. We became a family. We understood each other. When we played we almost became one person. It was quite amazing. We played team after team, just enjoying the experience, and when we would win time and time again, we would kind of just laugh it off as a fluke, or we would assume the other team had no experience. But, before we knew it, we were in the final game, playing for the title. We all expected that this would surely be where our luck ran out, but it was not. We won.

The morning before the championship game I remember I had woken up with blisters on each of my big toes. I couldn't even walk and as a catcher we have to put support and all our body weight on our toes the whole game so this was not going to go well. I rushed to the store to see if they had anything and they ended up having a sort of blister remover. This blister remove worked wonders but I could still feel pain when putting weight on the toes affected. A friend and teammate of mine recommended that I spray the stuff soccer players spray on their ankles to fight through pain. One of the umpires for the game had some cans in his car because his son played soccer and would complain of pain after every game. I sprayed some of the stuff on my toes and was able to fight through the pain for the game. It was like some anesthetic type spray but spray version of it. I liked it overall and it made the most sense. It was practical and really helped me in the long run. We ended up winning the game because of me being able to play. I feel like I am good at giving signs to the pitcher when I am the catcher. We had won the title and I was real proud of that.

The team was late for the game as our bus was stuck in the busy Long Beach traffic of the early summer. The weather was light and gray and it was the kind of day where you wake up sleepy no matter the amount of hours that you slept the night before. The team had been thrilled to be here in the first place. We were subpar team the year before and all of a sudden we were at the top of our game being able to compete with the best teams in the district. I had spent the night before just watching old dodger games trying to get pitching tips from the great Hideo Nomo. I was raised watching him and wanted to pitch just like him. My coaches told me otherwise though and let me know it is not a good thing because it hurts your back in the long run. We had arrived at Milikan Park. I didn't want to get off the bus as I was nervous as can be. We went in the locker rooms and I dressed up and was ready to pitch. We got on the field and surprisingly the stands were half empty. I was told that the fans weren't being let in because of a riot that happened there. Once the stands filled up I was up to pitch at the top of the 1st inning. I got on the mound. Surprisingly I was ready. I struck out the side in the first inning. I feel like overall my past history of failures lead me this inning and the rest of the game. I was tired of failing at all I tried and I wanted something new for a change. At the bottom of the ninth we were down 3-2 as the relief pitcher had let in 3 runs at the top of the inning. We managed to battle back and win it off a two run blast by my childhood friend Jim. It was what we used to dream of as kids. Winning anything together. It didn't happen in the pros but it felt like it did.

Just getting to hear any of the stories they had to tell us was such a treat. Especially the stories involving my grandparents! It sounds like my grandmother may have been quite mischievous when she was younger. I was also shocked to hear my grandfather smoked! He hated smoking in the time I knew him.

All white Americans are the descendants of people who immigrated, most over 100 years ago. I like how Andrew Yang wants to give a ""freedom dividend."" This means that every American over 18 will get $1,000 a month ""no strings attached."" Personally I think that with automation and AI (Artificial Intelligence) in the future there are not going to be enough jobs for people. ""If you brought it a trucker brought it."" It is safe to say that soon cars and trucks are going to be self driving. Within a decade your food order and a fast food restaurant will most likely be prepared by a robot. The self checkout lines at Target and Walmart are just the start, pretty robots will be stocking the shelves and running the warehouse. Yes, some high paying tech IT and engineering jobs will be created, but not enough to off set the loss of jobs. However, I LOVE robotics and AI (Artificial Intelligence). Just think of all of the accidents that self driving cars will prevent. Wouldn't it be awesome to relax  on your way to work and let the car drive itself? I favor and agree and lot with moderate Republicans. However, I think that Trump realizes that in the future there will not be enough jobs for the working and middles classes due to AI (Artificial Intelligence). He wants to avoid a situation where Universal Basic Income would need to be implemented. My theory is that he wants to get rid of all of the immigrant workers. He then will install tough work standards for people to get public assistance (Welfare/Food Stamps). Who would pay for Universal Basic Income, $1,000 a month for every American over 18? You need a thousand million to make a billion. To just crack the top 1% for a given year for a couple filling jointly or a single person looking at total income (wages, capital gains, and inheritances) you would need about $469,000 annually. If you are working and middle class please consider Andrew Yang the son of Korean Immigrants for President. You will get $1,000 per month starting at age 18.

It's not often that I completely embarrass myself in front of all my coworkers, but I definitely succeeded in doing that this past holiday season. About 6 weeks ago I went to a backyard cookout hosted by Mike. When I got there, Mike surprised me by asking me to watch his son during the cookout. I was pretty surprised because I didn't think Mike trusted me that much, but I guess he felt comfortable asking me because he knew I was a parent too. As the cookout started, I began talking to Mike's son and trying to entertain him. It was difficult to keep up with his energy, because he was 7 years old. Kids at that age seem to just have endless amounts of energy and always talk so fast it's hard to get a word in. After about a half hour of talking to his son, I was starting to get a bit bored and stressed. I decided to sneak a beer from the cooler without telling Mike. When I was finished drinking, I felt a lot more at ease and I wasn't getting stressed as much at the task of being responsible for Mike's son. I said to myself, what the heck, and decided to have a few more beers. By the third beer, things were getting a bit out of control. I don't remember doing this exactly, but according to my other co-workers, I took my shirt off and was running around the backyard pretending to be a unicorn by sticking the can of beer to my forehead and pretending it was my horn I guess. While my coworkers were not amused, Mike's son and all the other kids at the cookout were laughing hysterically at my crazy antics. Unfortunately, I didn't get to taste the burgers that Mike was cooking up the whole time as he unsurprisingly kicked me out. At least I didn't lose my job.",1,"Parent goes to backyard cookout during holidays.

It was memorable in the sense that it was the first planned outing with my children, who are still toddlers. It's been difficult as a homemaker with my toddlers, especially during the first couple of years. I feel like I sacrificed a lot to personally raise them, and sometimes I still feel ambivalent about my decision to have a family. So to say this was personally memorable, at least to me, might be a bit of an understatement. The part about the holiday party that stood out the most was just sitting in their backyard and drinking a beer straight from the bottle with the sun shining on my face. I was tasked with watching one of my toddlers while my spouse took care of the others. It felt easier with one kid. I think the work multiplies significantly with more children, and I can understand why most parents these days want to stick to one child. Anyway, that moment in the backyard felt relaxing, like something I hadn't experienced in a long time. It was equal parts freedom, and for a moment, it felt like I didn't have any kids at all. I mean, I had one that I was watching at that time, but that fleeting moment felt like a tasty raindrop when you're stranded in a barren hot desert wasteland. My children thoroughly enjoyed the event, despite not really eating the great food. They got to play around with other children that were also there, and they got to see what an actual party with adults seems like. I personally enjoyed it, and wish for more events like that in the future.",4,"Parent goes to backyard cookout during holidays.

Emotionally, I was worried about my dad and my mom. My mom didn't handle the situation well and made each trip unnecessarily dramatic.  My dad was aggravated by the entire situation because he felt that he could have driven himself. My mother acting like he was on his death bed day in and day out was not helpful to his state of mind either. Once at the hospital, it took many hours sometimes for the test to be performed. This was tedious and stressful. Socially, I had to turn down many activities with friends because the trips were time consuming and mentally exhausting.  My relationship with my girlfriend suffered because most of our conversations resulted in me complaining about various aspects of the situation or confessing my fears of losing my father. Not to mention the time we spent apart during this time. My relationship with my parents also suffered because the weight of the situation made for raw feelings and emotions which we took out on each other. Situations like this should bring people closer together but in this case it was horrible for us all in every way. I still harbor a lot of anger toward my mother because I feel that she is not helpful to my father's condition.

My mom insisted on joining, and she couldn't drive either, because she has a horrible sense of direction and gets easily lost.  So, once again, it was up to me to make the lengthy drive.  I knew the potential for the three of us to trigger various stresses in one another.  It's only worse when all three of us are together.  With just two, there's a bit lesser chance for a blow-up. The drive would be different this time, which posed a potential challenge.  There was construction happening that forced us to take an alternate route.  So, even though this was only a check-up appointment, and not an actual series of tests or an operation, the detour added a dimension of unpredictability. While I was bothered by having to go through this experience a sixth or seventh time, I knew it was important.  Letting either of my parents make the drive themselves would have been selfish on my part, and made things worse for them.

Driving him and my mother to and from the hospital (and to and from the months of tests preceding the surgery) were stressful, but ultimately bonding.  We do not normally travel well together, under casual circumstances.  So, the trips with my father's health in question only added to the possibility of argument and tempers.  I felt in the role of caretaker during these trips and waiting room experiences, being the only one who could manage their stress adequately enough to manage the one hour of interstate traffic both ways.  It was a role I felt forced to take on, but I was also grateful to have some sort of way to repay my parents for times they had supported me in stressful situations.  We learned to set more trivial elements of road trip stress aside.  And we even went on some trips in between hospital visits to help relax.  I learned that while I can handle the thought of my parents falling ill, or even dying, my mother's views on death have changed.  She was the person who taught me to see death as just another part of life.  But now that she's getting closer to old age, she seems to fear it.  The subject is one that can't be just theoretical.  I guess people don't know how they'll react until the subject is staring them in the face.  For some reason it bothered me how stressed my mother got.  She seemed to jump to the worst conclusions.

It was in April of this year.  It was a very memorable trip for me.  I love spending time with my wife, and when we can get away at the last minute that just makes it that much more special.  Gatlinburg is where we spent our honeymoon, and it has special significance to us.  This time was special because we just bonded so much more than we usually do. We got to do more things because the weather was warmer this time around.  We got to stay close to downtown, so we took a lot of walks together to a lot of different places.  The most memorable part was sitting on a balcony at a restaurant overlooking the main road that goes through town.  We spent hours there just talking and people watching.  I still think about that afternoon and how much fun we had together just being together and not really doing anything at all.  Besides that day, we had a couple great meals at some neat places.  We also went to try a new place out that was really bad, and yet we still made the most of it.  Overall, that trip was one of my most favorite times of my life.  It was because I spent it with my favorite person I've ever met.  We still talk about how we can't wait to go back, but I don't think any trip will compare to that one.",1,"My wife and I took an impromptu trip to one of our favorite places.

We started with a cheese and crackers platter, fruit bowl and everybody pretty much brought something for the buffet. There was so much food it made me feel a little guilty even about those they don't have enough to eat. The kids were in the back yard playing ball, some were exploring the wooded area, others were on the swing set. It was almost like a school playground there were so many of them. One little girl exclaimed look a family of deer. All the kids stopped to look at the mommy deer and her 3 fawns, so majestic. The screeching of the kids drove the deer away and it was back to playing. The adults were enjoys the food and the drinks were flowing freely. Lots of beer, wine and liquor. My niece made a pitcher of mojitos and a pitcher of margaritas. At this point everybody was feeling pretty good. My brother in law had drank a few to many and then the yelling started. ""MAGA"" was yelled out by him at my nieces husband from Mexico ""build the wall"", ""go back where you came from"". Now some of the other men stepped in as hands were going to be thrown. My brother in law was restrained and my niece was in tears. Her husband walked out and slammed the front door as he left. Now my sister is screaming at my brother in law,  ""just shut up, this happens every time you drink"", ""you ruin everything"" and then she started crying too. My sister and niece hugged each ""I hate dad"" she exclaimed. My brother stormed off to the basement to get away from the drama. The kids resumed their play. The adults were all talking about what a jerk my brother in law is, even though the party is at his house.

We cooked a lot of good food and had drinks a few times.  It was fun for the siblings to get together at night after the kids went to bed to reminisce.  We saw some deer pretty close to us one time and the kids were able to see them up close.  We would also take bike rides.  We went out to eat a couple times and the places were really good.

We discussed renting a nice lake house or something a bit closer to everybody next time.  It is hard to meet up often because we are all scattered out over the country.

We had grown up together, going to grade school and later middle school and high school.  While we ended up living in different states after college, I thought I knew him very well.  He didn't come across as the type to go to one of those rallies or one who would support their ideology.  His social media didn't even provide any clues as to this.  I found out because another friend hit me up about some weird pictures on John's Facebook profile.  It turns out, he had created a setting to hide this from most of his friends and family.  He was only posted that stuff to his new 'friends'.  His old friends and family received a 'sanitized' version of his life.  This version was free from the hateful rhetoric on his unfiltered page.  He was obviously conflicted about it, or he would not have been filtering it from others.  I confronted John about it, as we had always been accepting of others and tolerant towards all but the intolerant.  On the phone call, he got really quiet for a second.  Then said that he was actually glad this came out and that he had long felt I was a 'naive libtard' and that I needed to wise up.  I was crushed that a friend had been lured down what I feel is a dark path of xenophobia and hatred.  I had no idea.  It pains me, but he has since cut off contact.  As a result of this, I have made a point to keep in closer contact with distant friends and to always let them know that I am there for them if they need to talk with someone.

Shortly thereafter, she suddenly had to leave and her reason behind it was unclear and sounded suspicious, but knowing her I summed it up to she was lying about what she was really going to do and I didn't really care too much.  The next day I was getting ready to leave to go to the bank and I opened up my desk drawer and the money was gone!  I checked my wallet and purse to see if for some reason I had put it in there, although I know for a fact that I never moved it. I immediately knew that she had stolen the money from me, and her wishy-washy excuse for leaving now made perfect sense. I was furious. I called her immediately and she did not answer.  I called her 3 more times and she still did not answer.  So I sent her a text message and pretended like everything was ok so that she would call me back. She called me back and I asked her if she took the money.  She claimed to not know what I was talking about and tried to blame it on my kids (who were all asleep when she was there) and I could sense that she was lying yet again.  There was not much that I could do at this point but to write her off as a friend and know that she could not be trusted.  This was extra hurtful to me because I now had to come up with $800 of my own money to pay for the tickets since I was the person trusted to do this.  I struggle financially as it is, so $800 is a lot of money to me.",1,"My sister needed me to purchase a gift for her husband on her behalf and gave me $800.

We walked along Lake Michigan and looked at the Azure water. We felt the warm breeze coming off the Lake. Sailboats cruised in the distance. We went to the Chicago Museum of Art. They had a large exhibition of folk art, which we enjoyed. They even had some van Goghs. We stayed there for hours, enjoying the beauty of creation. We then went to the Magnificent Mile. We enjoyed all the departments stores. We spent too much money but we had a lot of fun. As we walked back to the hotel along Lake Michigan. We saw big storm roiling the lakes waters. Though it was only 3:30 in the afternoon, it became as dark as midnight. A huge gust blew on me. I try to keep my balance, but I was thrown right into the waters of the Lake.  The water was deeper than I was tall. I flailed and splashed around. Suddenly, a man in an orange vest appeared next to me. He put his arm around me and pushed me up where another man grabbed me.

It actually had an odd beginning. My daughter had complained to our mutual employer (in Chicago) that she had never flown in an airplane and that it was the only item on her bucket list. The next week, they offered to fly us out for a meeting and a lunch with them! I decided to take the entire family and make a nice little vacation out of it. We had a fantastic visit with my employers. After a short meeting, they took us to a great Greek restaurant where I tried several new foods. From there, we went to our hotel which was located in the heart of the city. We visited an architecture museum and learned a lot about the origins of the city. We also went to see The Bean, which is a chrome bean that is absolutely enormous and sits in the middle of a park. We went to the Navy Pier and had some great food. The highlight (or perhaps the lowlight) of the trip was our lunch where we ate traditional Chicago deep dish pizza. The pizza was unreal- so thick and cheesy! Even though I was starving I could only eat a single slice. But just as we were eating, the city got hit with a tremendous thunderstorm. I have never encountered anything like it before. It was downright traumatizing though fortunately, it passed quickly. We wrapped up the short trip after another day of museum hopping and shopping.

The car ride went more smoothly than I thought it would with a baby in the car. Granted, we did leave in the early hours of the morning, so the kids slept for a little while. We stayed in a community of rental homes in a very nice neighborhood. The house was beautiful and it met all of our needs for the trip. There was also a huge lagoon style pool on the property that we made use of during our stay. The kids had a blast swimming in it. I think the most exciting part of our trip was seeing our little girl (3) at the beach for the first time. She was just in awe of everything. She kept running down to the water and running back across the sand, and her excitement was just infectious. It means a lot to me that we are able to take our kids to do things like this and have fun experiences, because I know a lot of people are not so lucky. We are not rich by any means, but as long as we can give our kids love and a taste of life, I am happy. It filled my heart to see her so enjoying herself.

We stayed in a lovely rental house in Rosemary Beach, about an hour from Destin. The drive was not too bad, about five hours from our home, but it was long enough with small children in the car. I was nervous about this trip because it was our first family vacation and I have a hard time managing my two strong-willed children, especially when they are together. Sure enough, by Day 2 I was exhausted. I had to carry my youngest on my hip probably ninety percent of the time, even including when we were at home. He woke up at 5:30 AM every morning, so I was forced to do so as well. We engaged in a variety of activities including souvenir shopping, visiting the community pool, going to the beach, and watching a bottlenose dolphin show at an aquarium. Probably my favorite thing we did was go to a natural spring that wasn't far from where we were staying. The water was a beautiful aquamarine and clear as it could be. The only problem was it was COLD! We had a blast wading and swimming a bit, and just enjoying the beautiful scenery.

More importantly, because I am still young, it shows that I am gaining a growing reputation in my field. I work in a relatively large area in terms of population, but my field isn't very big. Most people who work in the field know one another and word spreads quickly. In the time I've with my current employer, I've already met many of my counterparts at other organizations. I've also met many of the owners and supervisors of other organizations in the field. Getting a promotion and more recognition so quickly will allow me to have more options if I decide to leave my job. Additionally, it made me feel good that I was able to impress my bosses. Many young employees don't get the opportunity that I've gotten so far so it was important that I made a good impression. I've found that people appreciate my work ethic and my hard work, which are two things that are important to me.

Any chance they get, they'll skirt out on some adventurous trip to enjoy the outdoors. Both of them love being active and very much enjoy nature. I've always being an outdoorsy person, too. As a young child, I played many sports and you could always find me playing outside! I had a tetherball set up in my backyard, lots of roller skates, bikes and scooters. I loved going hiking, taking my sister to the park, taking our dog for a walk and so many other activities that involved enjoying the outdoors. My love for the outdoors continued passed my childhood. Once I had my daughter, a lot of her activities took place outside the house. I definitely think I passed on the love for the outdoors to my daughter. About six weeks ago, my daughter and her husband took a road trip out to Texas. They decided to forgo Thanksgiving plans and instead go camping. They had told me of their plans and I was super excited for them. I wanted to join but I had already committed to a Thanksgiving dinner party. On Thanksgiving day, I get a frantic call from my daughter. She tells me she is bleeding quite a bit and she had missed her period for a few months. I told her to try to relax and suggested she call her doctor. She cut the camping trip short and returned home promptly. The bleeding continued but it had subsided a lot. She had an appointment a couple of days after Thanksgiving and a blood test revealed she was pregnant. She returned to the doctor a couple of weeks later and to our surprise, the ultrasound showed not one but two kids!",4,My daughter and her husband announced the were expecting their second child.

One of the most memorable events in recent weeks was the gender reveal ultrasound.  Since my son-in-law's family historically only produces boys, they were not surprised when their first child, Braxton was a boy.  So going into the most recent ultrasound even the doctor assumed that they would learn that the twins were both boys as is the tradition in their family.  However, that was not to be the case this time!  They are expecting twin girls in early January of 2020.  At this time, it as not been determined if the twin girls will be identical or fraternal.  The doctor indicates that the girls can be safely delivered anytime after 35 weeks into the pregnancy.  With a projected due date of January 20th, it is possible that our family could welcome the babies yet in 2019.  This would be an added blessing of two additional tax deductions on the Federal Income Tax Filing.

I think I am now starting to fully come to grasp with the idea that I do not need you to survive or be the best version of myself. For the longest time I thought I relied on you, that the image of ""us"" is what kept me strong and instilled confidence in me. Having made it through the remainder of the summer and single, I was able to spend a lot of time focusing on me. At first I thought perhaps it was because I wasn't good enough, or that I was doing something wrong. I can clearly see now that it is much more the idea of us both holding on to more of a perfect but unrealistic version of us being together. Perhaps you had seen this first... maybe you saw this a while ago, yet for me I am now just starting to see it. I am finally starting to smile again and find interest in old hobbies that I seemed to have lost when we were together.

Days later, I tried to reconnect and work on the relationship, but you were no longer interested. It hurt me tremendously. I was counting on you for years, and despite all our problems, I was still trying to fix things. Used to our fights, I expected things to fall back into place in the next few weeks, since we could never stay away from each other for too long. That never happened.

It had the number of rooms that I wanted and it was in a condition (aesthetically) that I loved. By this I mean that certain rooms like the kitchen and bathroom were up-to-date and I didn't have to do much to fix these places to be more to my liking. Because the house was so beautiful, I decided to get the works with it - I invested in a gate, a few security cameras and have a subscription to ADT to make sure that everything is protected. To be honest, all of these things make em feel very safe. It is in a great neighborhood where I know all of the people who live in the community and even the association people are friendly and nice to all of us that live here. The most memorable thing that I recall in this house is finding it to begin with. Before getting this house, there was a period of time in my life where I was deeply into the movies that centered around beautiful natural phenomena, like red tide or the aurora borealis. After praying that I could find someplace good to live with all the bells and whistles I wanted, I went onto Zillow to find my prefect place. I found a place, someplace gorgeous that had all the amenities I was looking for at a price I loved. In a good area, I deigned to look at what the street was called and lo and behold the house was on Aurora Lane. I knew this house was meant for me and it showed that my religion always comes though for me. I do believe there is a God up there and this experience has shown me that it is indeed the case, the way things matched up so surprisingly nicely and personally to me. I wish someone else could have an experience like mine because I loved how it all went about.

Jimmy is roughly the same age as my son. They grew up together. We spent vacations visiting my folks and my brother  lived in the area. So Jim would always be around, vacations holidays etc. I had not seen his dad in many years. The wedding was at a wonderful venue, a romantic B&B with a stunning setting. A beautiful lake that the wedding venue looked over. We all spent time on the deck drinking and smoking cigars. One of the shocking events was watching my cousin (female) smoking a cigar with the men. Then to top it off her mom who was 70+ comes out and takes the cigar from her and takes a few puffs on it. Again the reason it was meaningful to me was it had been 10+ years since I had seen many of the people. My wife and I actually were thinking that we last saw them when my wife was pregnant with our 12 year old daughter. It was the first time I actually danced at a formal event with my daughter.

She was a sweet, gentle soul; could almost pass for an angel. Chatting with her felt like a bliss, we could almost relate on anything. There were lots of topics to talk about, chit chats about our past memories in school; it really gave us things to smile and laugh about. Our discussions at the early stages were a bit friendly nothing intimate, but as days passed it got more intimate and romantic. We got to know our favorite colors, food, hobbies, future plans and basically everything about us. We never saw physically but emotionally we were very close to each other. Video calls helped a lot, in terms of reducing our tension, nervous nature and early shyness that happens in almost all relationships. After about a month, we decided to fix a date when we could see. We chose an nice restaurant to meet, which was not quite far from us both. Finally, we met and all I can say is, she was the most beautiful girl my eyes has ever seen. Never knew one could be so perfect, her smiles were genuine and flawless. There was just something about the way she carried herself, you could tell she was very confident in her skin. Our conversation never changed, it was as if we were old friends who just met after a long time. The attraction was there, none of us could even deny it; there and then, I told her my intentions. From that day till now, the relationship has been a bliss; we match well in almost all aspects and would love to spend the rest of my life with her.",1,I met a woman I knew in high school on social media and we got together.

A month ago, when there were warnings that people should leave the area because T.S. Imelda was coming, a cyclone that was predicted to hit our area in Texas, we thought the storm was minor. We were even unconcerned when it was reported in the media that the storm had been upgraded to a tropical storm. We thought that after Harvey, we were secure because we had carried out major constructions on our house. Then one morning, out of nowhere, our house was flooded. It was unbelievable. It took us unawares. There was no news about it happening that morning. We were practically unaware that that morning was going to be the worst in our entire lives. I woke my wife in bed and she screamed. It was a scary experience. The first thought that came to my mind was that this was extremely tough on us after Harvey. One month ago, we had a beautiful home but right now, we are struggling to keep it in good shape. We are presently staying with friends because the house is said to be in uninhabitable conditions.

We didn’t expect this storm to be what it was so we not prepared. The rain fell for the whole day and we slowly watched the water rising. When it got to about ankle high we went ahead & moved the vehicles to higher ground(we learned our lesson from Harvey). We went back to the house & started lifting everything ground level up. After about 4 hours water started coming in the house. We grab some bags & our dog in the husbands truck & went down the road to a friends house. The next day we went back down to see the damage that was done. It wasn’t anywhere what Harvey was(we got 3 feet of water)but just enough to soak all the carpets & floors probably an inch of water. So we called our insurance companies immediately they were out the next day. That didn’t turn out like I thought it would it has been a tedious process. First off they want pictures from before Harvey & after Harvey to prove the work we had done after the last store plus all the receipts. Then they want the pictures of the house now & as the work is being done this time. Then we are stuck staying with friends who we love but two families can not live together for very long without tempers flaring. It’s been about a month & there finally done with the house repairs.

It took a lot of work and effort but I made it.  Several times, along the way, I felt like quitting.  Looking back, I wonder how I could have made it.  One time I finished a 60 page report that was due the next day. After taking a break before I was to proofread it, I went to my computer only to find my report gone!  I was frantically trying to find it over and over.  I called my parents to tell them what happened. They tried to console me. I felt better after the phone call and, after about an hour of feeling sorry for myself, I decided I better get to work rewriting the whole paper.  I was up all night rewriting it, but I did it.  I think the second time around was much better and I ended up getting an A. That was only one of many times when I felt like I couldn't take any more.  Another time I was doing a lab report.  I had been working the whole semester on a lab project.  Every day I collected data for the report.  Near the end of the semester I went to the lab to work on my project and wrap it up.  When I got there, somebody had broken in to the lab and completely ruined my project along with several other people's. Half the class was distraught over that incident and complained to each other. Fortunately our professor was kind enough to accept our unfinished data and notes.  We all received an A for our projects.  These are just two of the many obstacles I had to overcome.

The most memorable part was the submission of my dissertation for graduation. I had spent so much time away from my family, and I had spent a lot of money trying to accomplish this goal. I spent a lot of time avoiding friends, avoiding exercise, and avoiding family in order to finish this project. It was trying because I missed my family and friends. I also had a very trpubling experience with my adviser, who tried to fail me twice and required me to do extra work. But it was an emotional moment, too. Overall, I was moved because so many people supported me and my goals. By the end of the project, my friends and family had helped me through the hardest time of my life. This was a significant moment because my family had very little education. My mom died when I was young, so I had a lot of difficulty achieving this goal.

I'm 50 years old and have the 3 most amazing children in the world. Their ages are 25, 19 and 20 ( almost 21). Two boys and a girl (the youngest). I spent the vast majority of  the last half of my life caring for my children. Now that they are older, I was excited to explore and excel in my professional career. My professional background is Healthcare Operations/Revenue Cycle Management. I Have managed Doctor offices, Hospital departments, taught Medical Billing and Coding, etc. This career path began in 1996. However, I needed a change in my career path therefore I started working for a behavioral health software company in about three years ago. Little did I know how this job would impact my life. At first, it was very exciting as I was travelling a lot. This was the  most memorable and exciting aspect of the job. I was able to go to states that I would've never dreamed of traveling to. Unfortunately, to my greatest surprise, there were more projects then the staff to handle. everyone on my team were overloaded with work. The standard was 4 projects at a time. But due to the overload, I was given 6-8 projects back to back. I started overworking myself to meet project deadline. The more I did that the more my health declined. I keep pushing myself more and more because I really liked the implementation and project management aspect of my career path. unfortunately, I became more and more ill and I could no longer meet deadlines. Therefore, I was laid off and had to find another career path with less stress. While recovering from my illness, my financial struggle was real. I nearly lost my home, my car, etc, so thank God for my amazing family and friends that I am able to bounce back.",1,"I wrote about how I lost everything in my life and wondered around lost and hopeless for years.

He had never planned a vacation without me so I was very shocked but excited.  Neither of us had ever been to Disney world before so it would be a first for both of us.  The day started out hitting up some of the rides.  Mid day we were both a little tired so we went back to the hotel to rest up and shower.  He had made dinner plans for us that evening.  We both rested and got cleaned up and then headed back to the park.  He had made reservations near Cinderella's castle so that we could watch the fireworks as we ate.  It was so beautiful and romantic to see the fireworks light up the castle.  As dinner was wrapping up the waiter came out with two glasses of champagne.  I was so caught up in watching the fireworks that I failed to notice that my boyfriend was now down on one knee.  I couldn't believe what was happening!  My mind was whirling as I screamed out yes!  I jumped up to hug my boyfriend.  The next thing I know I hear some familiar voices calling out congratulations behind me.  I turned around to see my two best friends behind me.  My boyfriend had flown in my two sisters so they could be hear to celebrate with us.  That had to be the most memorable part of the evening seeing them.  I couldn't believe that he planned this whole romantic evening himself.  I also couldn't believe that my sister's kept this secret from me.  I just thought I was taking a simple weekend getaway with my boyfriend.  I never had a clue that I would head home two days later engaged to be married.

Lots of cars drove by, kicking up water and dirt as they sped through. I was in a rather bad mood as I dont very much care for the rain in Seattle. As I was walking home, I noticed an old man sitting on a bench, he had dirty unkempt gray hair hidden by a rather old beanie. A dark tan coat dirtied by years of reliance, his face was pale with grime throughout. He had been on the bench for quite a while, I'd seen him around town before. As I walked closer, I could see tears rolling down his cheeks. He was crying, silently, of course. The look of utter misery in his face prompted me to inquire into why exactly he was crying. I had never asked someone why they were crying like this before, I didnt exactly know how to approach the man so I awkwardly shambled close to him and sat down.""What's wrong sir? I noticed you were crying."" I asked softly.""I'm extremely sick, I went to the free clinic and I've found that I have no chance of life more than a few months. That's whats wrong, now if you'd leave me be, I'd appreciate it.""He looked quite defeated in that moment, like nothing mattered in that moment. I decided the only real thing I could do was hand him my cup of coffee, as a small reminder of some good in the world.""I can't offer much to your situation, but here you go, a fresh cup. Enjoy what little time you have left, man."" These words probably sounded more offensive than anything, he silently took the cup and muttered a thanks. I felt slightly better, the mans plea had dug into my heart and left me quite pained. I wasn't quite sure what to do with myself as I headed home.  I felt as if I'd made a difference but I couldn't be sure/",5,"One day, I saw a man sitting alone crying on the side of the street. He was homeless and I had found out that he was deathly ill.

I also got to catch up with another old friend who has a toddler now too. The cake was made by my friend and was beautiful.

This was very exciting for me because this is my first close friend to have a child while I have two already and another that is due soon. Because we have been so busy since adulthood, her with work, and me being a mom, working, and going to school, it was a great opportunity to get together. My daughter was especially excited because she was really wanting the new baby to be a girl, but it is not. She has that opportunity to spend time with a baby girl. Even though they are not actually family, me and my friend have always been so close that the kids will be raised more like cousins than friends. I also got to see her family for the first time in a while which was nice. It felt like 'coming home.' This family is one that I have spent many holidays with over the years, including major holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas that you typically spend with family. There were no other friends of the family at the party, it was only family members and that made me feel quite warm. It also was the first time I got to see my friends new house. She had been living with her spouse and baby at her mom's house since she was pregnant and it was very exciting to see them moving out and being more independent. While I love her family, it is always good to have your own space as an adult. I really look forward to our kids growing up together and couldn't be happier still. We even talked about having sleepovers with my 6 year old daughter and her 1 year old.

His dad passed away a few months ago from cancer and it was tough on everyone. We always played golf with his dad after school since we were both on the team. His dad was a mentor to myself and someone I looked up to. I never thought we would be playing in a golf tournament together which supports the cancer foundation. We arrived early and bought a memory bag which they set on one of the greens in memory of a loved one. We were team number 8 so we had to wait for the others to start golfing first. We finished 18 holes of golf in a few hours and then met back at the shelter to see the results board. We finished third which was alright with me. It was emotional when we had to receive our award because he gave a short speech about his father. Then we headed over to the local pub and had a few beers to wind down. It was a special moment in my life. My friend appreciated my support and I was more than happy to lend a hand. Next year we plan of getting there early so we can be the first to tee off.

We decided it would be a good way to honor his life, by playing another tournament this summer. We all got ready to go, and the mood was kind of heavy. When we arrived, my friend seemed very sad. I attempted to lighten the mood by telling everyone a funny story about my friends father. We all shared some laughs and shared some more favorite memory's of his father.

While it was difficult to be too surprised at this result, he had seemed to be doing well and living a good life, and the hope was that he was on the road to recovery. Unfortunately this was not to be the case.   One thing that both me and my dad as well as him and his dad had in common was our love of golf.  It was something that we often did together and had taken numerous golfing vacations together.  These trips had become a highlight of the year for all involved and something to look forward too.  My dad works for a healthcare company that specializes in cancer treatments and as long as he has been working there we had played in a golf tournament that helps to sponsor families that are fighting cancer and does such things as send kids to a summer camp or pay for a day at an amusement park.  Something that will allow the family to enjoy their time together and get away from the fight against cancer for awhile and feel like a normal family.  There is one hole that is called the dedication hole.  It is where you write a name down of someone who has been effected by cancer in your life and every member of the group tees off at the same time.  When we pulled up to the tee box my friend got very emotional and began to cry.  Looking back it makes complete sense that he would feel this way, but I just hadn't thought of it as he is someone who almost always keeps his emotions close to his chest.  In turn the rest of the group became emotional as we have all been friends for more than 15 years.  We all wrote down his dad's name on our balls and gave them to him after the round.  While the whole day was fun and we all had a blast at this moment we all felt the gravity of what our friend had gone through and it made us closer as a group.",2,My friends and I played in a golf tournament earlier this summer for a cancer support foundation.

I played with three of my good friends who I have known since high school.  One of my friends recently lost his dad to cancer.  I was very close to his dad and remain close to his entire family.

On this hole every person is given a new golf ball where they write the name of someone who has been effected by cancer in your life.

This is a tournament that both of us have played in for a number of years, but even so I didn't foresee the level of emotions that we would have at this point.  I think that this will be something that will stick with both of us for a long time.

She started crying and asking for my forgiveness. While continuing crying, she apologized for all of the things that she did to me. I was starting to get embarrassed as other people were looking over at our table. Awhile ago I had said that I would never forgive her for the constant insults and verbal abuse that she hurled at me over the years. But in that moment, I saw the sincerity and remorse in her eyes. She wanted to try to fix the things that she had done. I accepted her apology and we had started the first step in rebuilding our relationship.

We spent many hours crying and talking about the past, as well as the future. We learned new things about each other. For the first time, I felt like my mother understood me.

I would have written about it sooner, but I needed time to process my thoughts about the event, because it was somewhat traumatic.  Now that some time has passed, I think I have enough perspective to talk about it and express how I feel. Three months ago, I wrecked my beautiful truck.  I was coming home from work after the late shift, and it was raining.  I was going down New Road  about 11pm.  I rounded a corner, and there were four deer in the road.  I know right, my greatest fear when driving home at night.  I swerved to miss the deer, which I did successfully, but I went into a spin on the slick wet road.  I slid completely off the roadway and ran into a tree.   Fortunately, I had my seat belt on, because I hit the tree head on.  The airbags deployed and the seat belt did it's job, and I was only shaken up.  The truck was completely totaled and I was so upset about this.  I worked so hard for that truck and I just couldn't believe that God would let this happen to me.   I was upset for weeks.  The insurance did replace the truck, but it just wasn't the same. Now, after several weeks have passed, I realized how ungrateful I was in being upset about the truck.  The important thing is that I walked away completely unhurt.  Not even a scratch.   Trucks you can replace, but I was really fortunate that night.

The accident happened on the Highway as I was getting onto the entering ramp.  It happened as I got off work.  My shift was late at night.  I worked late that night and I was exhausted and very tired.  It seemed like a normal work night as I cloaked out and proceeded to my truck.  The only thing that was different that night is that I was very tired from working.  Sometimes I take a nap before I drive home.  For some reason I did not take a nap to rest up before I started my trip home.  As I was driving to get on the ramp to the Highway I started to go around the curve of the ramp.  Halfway around the ramp I soon lost control of the truck.  I did not realize the the road was wet.  While I was working it rained a little but I did not noticed.  As I accelerated up the ramp I lost control of the truck.  My steering wheel locked.  My front truck tires locked as well.  As I lost control of my truck it seemed like my entire life flashed before me i those few seconds.  I was really scared.  I hit the guard rail and crashed my back bumper.  I got out of the truck and realized that I was not hurt.  I walked away from the accident unharmed and I am very grateful.,2,"I crashed my truck on a rainy night after work.

I feel that relates to this scenario of getting an early promotion.,"I work for Walmart, a company I have been working for the past 3 years. Two weeks ago, I got a promotion. This promotion I had been waiting and hoping for, for the last year. I was finally promoted to Assistant Manager. It was an unexpected early promotion as I was not supposed to get promoted until September, instead I got promoted in July. It really came to a surprise to me that I got the promotion so early. I suppose it was because they really enjoy my line of work and love that I am work-driven and know how to complete tasks in a timely fashion and can be consistent and meet deadlines. At least, I hope that is why they decided to give the promotion to me as early as they did. I am very pleased with my work ethic, I enjoy this company a lot and think that I can bring new and fresh ideas to this company as well as be a great manager. I just didn't think that it would happen because even though I work so hard and I want to do a great job and make sure that I am always on time and I am always striving to be a better version of myself from the day before. I like to do well in the goals and tasks that I have set for myself on a daily basis when it comes to my job, or anything that I do. I am very grateful for this opportunity to be in this new position and so grateful to my employers above me that felt that I deserved this opportunity and are wanting me to progress and grow along side the company. I have put so much time and effort into this place and it's starting to pay off. I know that if I put in the amount of hours, work, and dedication that I can achieve anything and for that I am so proud and honor to be apart of this establishment. I am over the moon about this promotion and I ended up celebrating with my loved ones and family members with a bottle of bubbly berry juice (as I and my family members are not a fan of alcoholic beverages) and we went out to dinner afterwards to celebrate this new chapter of my life.",3,"I received a promotion at work about two weeks ago.

One arts shop we went in had artworks priced at least $10,000. The other interesting experience was to witness casinos in all the hotels we visited.

I decided to watch a little TV. I couldn't go to sleep, I was too anxious. Nurses were coming in to check my monitor, IV, and to see how far I was dilated. I can't remember exactly what time I got my epidural, but I decided to go ahead and get it before it was too late. I was at a 6 or 7cm at this point. The doctor who put the epidural in, had to take it out and redo it because I was still able to feel places I wasn't suppose to. After the second attempt, it was good to go. I was numb mainly on one side. As it would wear off, I was able to feel my contractions, so the nurses would come in and push the button for more. So far everything was good, the pain was manageable. I had family and friends come in and out. Around 7pm, my contractions were getting stronger, and my epidural was not working. The nurses would come in and check my cervix and see how far I was dilated. I was already feeling the urge to push, but they wouldn't let me. Around 8-8:30pm, the nurses came back in because I was in crucial pain. I was trying to jerk the IV out of my hand, took off the baby monitor because I didn't want anything on me or touching me.

So much good has occurred but I have to go back a little ways.  It all began 3 months ago. After several glasses of wine at a girls night, Holly made me go back online to my dating profile and check out my DMs. It was the standard garbage...as in: you are beautiful; want to hang out; how about we meet up and hook up. Ugh! There was also the standard aloof messages that just said ""Hi,"" ""Hello, how are you,"" and things of that general nature. I wasn't really in the head-space to notice one of the guys but Holly immediately noticed someone. His message was fairly normal but seemed a little more genuine, I suppose. Holly and I then checked out his profile and generally stalked as much as we could lol. Then she decided I should reply back to him...I did but almost just so she would stop making such a big deal out of it. Well, much to my surprise, he replied that night and after Holly left I chatted briefly with him as I got ready for bed. Amazingly, I didn't find any of our initial conversation cringy; we just sorta hit it off. Our messages back and forth were honest and it felt intriguing. I went to sleep that night wondering a bit about this new guy but I didn't really have my hopes up - the guard was definitely still up. Anyway, over the next few days we exchanged messages and at some point, I gave him my cell number and we started texting! About 1.5 days into this, he called me and asked me out to dinner --- and soon --- it was going to be the next night; I was nervous but I agreed to meet him. This is where I generally thought things would fall apart as they usually do, but that night we met at a small, quaint, Italian restaurant downtown. We ordered a glass of red and some pasta and what ensued was awesome and blew me away. We talked and talked and just generally enjoyed our food and company. My biggest test - you know the one where I tell the guy that I'm a single mom and I have lupus mostly to see their reaction - well, he didn't even flinch. And instead, he engaged with me about my experiences and was empathetic. That's when I finally realized and believed, this guy is amazing. It had only been a short time but we really hit it off; looking back it almost feels like it was meant to be. I'm so happy to say we are still talking 3 months later...more to come,yay!",1,"After only talking for 2 days after meeting online, I met a guy for dinner.

My brother is a gentle person, but can sometimes appear to have a gruff, adversarial or judgmental tone.  When the waiter came to speak to us, my brother asked him if the salt and pepper dish (can't recall what it was, beyond the salt and pepper part) was spicy.  The waiter answered that it was not. My brother, in asking for clarification, spoke in a tone that seemed to offend the waiter.  He (my brother), said ""But the menu says it has salt and pepper on it."" The waiter seemed to jump back, and said (quite haughtily) that he would not be spoken to in that way.  After this exchange, my brother became quiet. I think he had no idea that the waiter had been offended.  I, who am used to my brother's questioning ways, was very surprised to see the waiter act so offended.

He requires precision from everyone around him.  He started asking a lot of questions about the food options. The waiter became offended, even though there was nothing offensive about the questions. But the waiter didn't like my brother's tone of voice.  At one point he stepped back and said ""I don't need to be talked to like that.""  It was kind of sad.

It's near the old cathedral and serves organic wine. It had just opened and was on a charming street with old style street lamps and cobble stones and had a comfortable, cozy and dark atmosphere inside. I had wanted to try it and it was good to see her. I didn't realize that she had invited several other friends of hers, people I know a bit but not too well. I wasn't planning on drinking as much as I did, thinking that she and I could have a couple of glasses of wine each and go home. But the conversation took a life of its own, the bottles of wine were ordered and drunk. I was enjoying myself and did not realize how much wine I had to drink. Lauren ordered a charcuterie board as well, which was delicious and seemed to encourage more sips of wine (to go with the cheese, of course). We were laughing and gossiping about the other colleagues in our department. Before I knew it I was drunk and feeling unstable on my legs. We all were and only left once the bar closed. I have no idea how I got home. Cabs are expensive so I must have braved the train late at night on my own, which is not safe. The next morning I woke up and felt terrible. My mouth was like cotton wool, I was dehydrated and my skin looked blotchy. That's it, I concluded! This cannot happen again. I need to detox, step back from drinking so much and take better care of myself. No more late nights alone on the train without the use of my full faculties. It has been surprisingly easy. I thought I would crave wine but I do not miss it or the hangovers. I appreciate feeling good, hydrated, and have been running and exercising more consistently. I wish I had done it sooner and it will be easier to limit the wine going forward, I really believe.",2,Waking up on 48th birthday morning hungover sent me on a path of discovery.

I woke realizing I needed a change, a new direction in life. Going sober for 30 days seemed like an easy undertaking, at least at first. Let the journey begin! Day 1 was inspiring, I visualized my future self as a sober successful and highly functioning human. Big announcements were made to all of my friends and family about this new undertaking, the new sober me. Day 2 - 5, this is easy being sober and slightly more functional. Motivation to work out kicked in around Day 6, which lasted until about Day 9. Day 10 - 15, I yearned for this new and improved sleep I was promised so early on in my quest for sobriety and it finally came. The deepest soundest sleep I have had in years, it felt amazing to wake up so tired because you slept so hard - I got this! Day 16 - 20, still sleeping and I guess I am a better functioning human. Still hate my job and only slightly more motivation to work out. Day 21, an invite to join friends at a bar - gulp! Could the new sober day me complete this test successfully? Yes, I did it! I went to a bar and woke up the next day feeling great - no hangover to plague me. Day 22 - 26, sleep is great, sleep is good but what about the higher functioning me? Have all of the years of almost daily drinking dulled my ability to be a higher functioning successful person? I only have 4 more days to figure this out, maybe it all clicks on day 30? The final 4 days were spent recapping this journey until it arrived, the big 3-0. I woke up that morning feeling nothing new or different, I am still the same me.",1,Waking up on 48th birthday morning hungover sent me on a path of discovery.

We had lunch, spaghetti to be precise. our little high school reunion was a memorable one. There’s really no reason for that. “Grease” predates my high school years and bears no resemblance to my experience at a small, all-girls Catholic school in Manhattan. We tended to listen to the Cranberries, who were popular at the time, more than anything else. But the words seemed to capture the love we have for one another and the desire to stay a part of one another’s lives. That said, we probably would have articulated our sentiments in full diagrammable sentences, or at least actual SAT vocabulary words. We were trying to remember the words to the song a few of our classmates wrote for our junior ring day, but I don’t think we made it beyond recalling the first stanza. Back then, we didn’t record everything on our phones, because we used the school payphone if we needed to make a call, so I don’t have hopes of finding a recording! thank you.",2,Me and  five friends went to dallas for a convention and stayed at an air bnb in the area.

After the 8 hour grueling trip with the obligatory stop at bucees we are there and looking forward to a good time. The line that we stood in felt like a mile long and we were definitely waiting for around an hour to an hour and a half to get inside but that was the only line for the weekend so not to bad. Inside though the culture is always great, just tons of love for video games and people and just everyone looking around having a good time buying things and relaxing. The air bnb was great also as we all just got to relax in a nice house in the suburbs and play games and talk. A friend of mine had bought a card game that doubled as a drinking game that day so we played that. It was a lot of fun everyone just sharing things laughing and overall just getting piss drunk. When everyone had deicded they had enough that night we called it quits and slept. The next day i woke up and wondered where everyone was and found a friend of mine awake. He figured they already went to the convention center so he and i walked to a dennys for breakfast. The meal was good and fun and from there we met everyone at the convention center. Was a great full day of hanging out explorering listening to panels then we headed back home for the night. We found out it was my friends birthday that weekend so we got him a cake and sang for him that night. The next day was our last day in dallas so we decided to just hang out again have some great food and visit spots around the city.

We bought the tickets last year about 7 or 8 months ago so for it to finally get here was different. It was even better because two of the friends going i did not get to see often and one had recently moved away. SO we piled 5 people 4 people into my friends car and started the 7 hour drive to dallas. The drive was awful it was hot outside but the company made it not so bad really. We stopped at Bucees and took in the great texas culture getting gas buying food and other things and eventually arrived at our AirBnB. We were the first there and quickly all made sure to choose a room with a single bed in it. Then the others arrived from their flights and it was great and so nice to just see everyone there again and say hi exchange pleasantry's etc. From there we went to the convention center on the first day and stood in a long check in line that made us all want to drive home. But after that it was great seeig all the booths meeting new people relaxing really made it feel like a vacation. That night we all hung out played a drinking game ordered food and really relaxed. Waking up late the next day was expected as we had a bit too much to drink but me and another friend took an uber and went and got some breakfast. The dennys was packed but the pancakes were great. The next day was just as good as the first but without the long checkin lineso we spent the day at the convention center and then went for some food at lunch. We ate  at this great wing restauraunt and had a great time then headed back before going home. That night we found out it was one of our friends birthday so we bought a cake and all sang happy birthday. We hung out at the house played some games and watched movies while having some drinks. Going forward to the last day two friends had to go home but the rest of us spent the day together relaxing and repeating all the last days. Fast forward to monday and it is time for us to head home.

The office organized several sets of interviews for all applicants. It was a really though period. There were weeks of interviews, and a lot of people were rejected based on the interviews.

We finally decided on an affordable spot that wasn't too far away from our previous homes, and we moved in together.

Both of us were used to living in one, and having to pay dues for that as well as follow a color scheme. I loved that I no longer had to conform to the rules and regulations of a seemingly pointless organization. To celebrate this, my partner and I decided to explore the area to find things to decorate our new yard with. We found an old school nursery nearby, (even the main business sign was a big piece of hand painted wood), and we bought some plants. Well, about 18 plants to be exact, and all but two of them were fruit or vegetable producing. So we planted these outside in our new yard to harvest. Besides the lack of HOA, we also didnt have to worry about pet fees, which was another thing neither of us were used to. Naturally, we had to celebrate this as well. Instead of a traditional dog or cat, we ended up getting 5 pets. These include 2 leopard geckos (one albino one regular), a veiled chameleon, a roboroverski hamster, and a havana rabbit.

It's a very warm and nice feeling to have your own place with someone you love. It took us about a week to find something nice and affordable in our area, so we bounced around hotels for that time and treated it like a bit of a vacation and a getting used to living with each other experience. We found a place we liked though and moved the very next day. It was a bit of a leap from how things used to be, but I'm glad I took the leap. It was definitely time in my life to try this out as I'm already 25 now. Heck, most of my friends are getting married now so I feel almost like an oddball.

Everyone at work was sad to see me go and I knew it was going to be tough leaving work because I had developed special bonds with many coworkers since I had a couple of decades working there. I thought it was going to be tough spending more time at home than at work and that eventually I would get bored and want to go back to work, so I left my position with the option of coming back if I had ever decided to.

We have the greatest time together because she such a sweet little girl and I have had the opportunity to care for her four days out of the week while her parents work. I am also able to do that for my daughter so she could go to work knowing that her daughter is in the best hands. I love my life right now and I would not trade it for nothing. I also was able to pick up my old hobby of painting and this all happened just one afternoon when I was cleaning out my attic and I found all of my old paintings. I relived the joy I had as I painted them as an adolescent and I decided I would pick up the hobby once more. It was tough to get back into it but once I had started painting again, I rediscovered why I loved it so much. I am even teaching my granddaughter to paint and she loves it also. It is a great bonding time with her that I would not have had if I had not retired. I truly feel as if I am living my life as I should at this moment and I do not regret my decision to retire as difficult as it was in the beginning since I am so used to be active.

Then i spent approximately the same amount of time as a counselor working at a non profit agency.  There are some who believe that this field of employment; working with all types of people who need a variety of services, is the number one field for burnout.  whether or not this is true, i can honestly say that when i had the chance to retire, i knew it was the right time.  The fact is that i had planned on working until i was 65 but i really needed to ""get out.""  I had lost a lot of my patience; little things were beginning to annoy me, and worst of all i didn't feel as if i was giving the clients my best efforts.

It was rather difficult to set up. I'm not a very tech savvy person, so it took about two hours to even get anything to display on the screen. By that point, my back was aching so badly and I felt exhausted, but I wanted to surprise my daughter with a little gift. When I brought her to the room, she seemed confused at first, but soon saw her favorite characters from the Secret Life of Pets 2 on the screen and let out a joyful scream. It was a very enjoyable experience! I baked some popcorn on our popcorn machine, picked out my daughters favorite candy, and brought some of her favorite toys to join in to watch the movie. One of her toys, ""Jim Bob,"" a large plush giraffe, sat next to my daughter and she briefly spoke to it whenever something interesting happened in the movie. She ended up loving the movie so much she wanted to watch it again. Now, that movie is extremely long, and while it definitely wasn't my favorite movie in the world, I'm glad that she was able to enjoy it so much. I mostly just sat back and watched as my daughter's smile lit up the room. I'm sure she didn't even know how much the projector cost or how hard it was to find one, but I was happy I was able to make her so happy. Moments like these always make me excited for the future. I wonder if ten years from now she'll want to watch this movie again on the projector and reminiscence about how she talked with her giraffe and tried to make him eat some of her popcorn. I wonder where she will be in ten years, and smile as I think about how she will look all grown up.",1,"I had a really fun childhood and I wanted to share that with my daughter.

I wanted to change that because I remember that I had a really fun childhood. My parents really went above and beyond to make sure I enjoyed my time as a kid. I've always held those values with me and wanted to pass them along to my daughter. So, I brainstormed ideas and I settled on the idea of setting up a movie theater in the backyard. I went online and did some research to get some inspiration on how to set it up. Once I had a solid idea of how I wanted to pull it off, I went to work researching projectors to find the best bang for my buck. I found a few on Amazon that I liked and, upon watching reviews on YouTube, I picked the one that was best. Surprisingly, it wasn't that expensive. I think I paid less than $300 for the whole setup. After I placed the order, I looked at my schedule to find a good night to do the movie night. When I had the details figured out, I informed my wife and she loved the idea. Before long, the movie projector came and tested it in my office while my daughter was playing outside. The quality and ease of use were impressive. It was able to be hooked up to a DVD player or a phone/tablet, which was perfect for us. I then waited until the night that I wanted to set things up. That day, she was out playing with friends and I was in the backyard secretly setting things up. I moved deck furniture and put a big blanket on the lawn. By the time i was done, it looked like a miniature living room. We then prepared snacks and broke the news to my daughter. She jumped up and down with joy before running to the backyard and freaking out over the setup. We had popcorn, candy, and sodas while watching the movie that night. It was so much fun and I really liked creating those memories for her. I felt really good afterwards and feel like I fulfilled my duties as a fun parent. At the end, my daughter ran up and hugged/kissed me and told me I was the best dad ever.",2,"I had a really fun childhood and I wanted to share that with my daughter.

This weekend, I decided to take a step forward to do that and bought a projector for my daughter. This projector will enable us to watch movies using a large screen or an empty wall. So, this weekend, I decided to set up a backyard movie night. I took the deck furniture and arranged it on the lawn to look like a living room. Then, I spread a moving blanket down to give us a clean area to walk. I set up a card table with the projector and DVD player along with the appropriate cords. I then put the screen together and anchored it to the ground using stakes. The screen was up against the side of the house to protect it from the wind. I tested the projector on the screen and it looked amazing. The sound quality was even good as well. Once I had everything set up, we popped some popcorn and got snacks. Finally, we told our daughter and she was super excited. She ran out to the yard and her face lit up as we all gathered around and watched Secret Life of Pets 2.

It is fascinating how life sometimes pleases us with gifts like this, she in her children always had trouble keeping attention and consent in anything. The professors noticed that their grades were not able to rise since in the classes they did not pay enough attention to understand and at the time of taking the exam I did not know what to do. But when I realized this and I was able to talk to her teachers and see her notes, I started working to help her personally. I started teaching her at home, I was sending her to do attention exercises and I was looking on Google what I could do to help her. My goal has always been for her to be excellent and I know she will be. At the beginning it was very difficult for him to keep his concentration for a couple of hours, since shortly after starting something he got bored or fixed his attention on something else. It was very stressful to feel that at first nothing worked to help her. I tried everything I found on google, but there was no improvement. It was at that moment when I decided to go to a specialist, and with her we did everything necessary to improve her attention. After a time of moments of stress, highs and lows we finally started to see an improvement. And it was there that I saw a light in the darkness, at last my daughter was beginning to improve her path to success was clearing up. I continued persisting with exercises and practices at home, and her grades began to improve, after being a bad student, she began to be a regular student, passed all her subjects with good grades, the teachers congratulated her.

As I think about all we did I feel sick in my stomach. The constant disciplining to form that necessary structure that her mind couldn't do easily on it's own. OMG all the words!

She was such a part of my life for the 24 years that I have been alive. When she passed away two years ago, I had just graduated from college and about to start my professional career. I had just been offered a job in a city on the other side of the country, and decided to move there, even though it meant being away from my friends and family. I know as the youngest of 4 children, this move was going to be hard on my Mom. She had always been so supportive of me throughout my life. She was always there for the good times, and the bad: when I fell off my bike and skinned my knee; when my first girl friend in junior high broke up with me; and when I didn't make it into my first choice for college. Mom was always there to comfort me and reassure me that everything was going to be alright. Mom had raised the four of us since my dad passed away when I was only six, and she devoted her life to us, really. Even though she had a college degree, and could have had a fulfilling career, she sacrificed that to make sure my siblings and I had good, safe home. The day I left for my new job and home, I said goodbye to Mom with tears in my eyes. I told her I would be home at Christmas, and not to worry about me. As always, she gave me a tight hug, and said that I would be successful at whatever I chose to do, and that she would always support me. I really thought I would see her in 4 months, so as I boarded the plane, I wave goodbye, thinking I'll see her soon. She looked to positive and hopeful, my last glimpse of her. It was only two days later, at my new job, that I got the terrible news. Mom had died suddenly from a massive heart attack. Even now, two years later, the day she died haunts me. There were so many things left unsaid to her. I thought I would have time to tell her how much she shaped my life and my character. How much she had sacrificed for me. She was only 60 years old, plenty of time to spend with her, plenty of time to let her know how much I loved her. Mom's sudden passing taught me to never wait to tell the ones you love how much they mean to you, how much you miss them. Time is short.",2,"My mom unexpectedly passed away 2 years ago.

I remember collapsing while trying to pack to fly to where she and my dad lived. I had a young daughter at the time and my heart was breaking for her that she would never get to know my mom. And that my mom wouldn't be able to get to know her. I mourned at the lost time and the major events my mom would not be apart of. It was heartbreaking. The rest of the day was a big blur, as I just went through the motions and didn't even really remember much. When we got to my parents house, we were surrounded by family and friends, but I felt so lonely. I remember just going into her room, and crying thinking how could this be happening. It was the worst day, and even 2 years later, it still is hard to breathe when I think about it.  She died from pneumonia. Something that happens all the time to people, but it took my mom.

They have different start times 5 minutes apart. The problem is that the schools are not 5 minutes away from each other; they are more like 15!  This is such a big day for both of them and I cannot wait to see them off to their first days of the rest of their lives. We are all very excited.  My wife and I had to come up with a plan to get each one to school on time, so they didn't feel out of place arriving late. Actually, we wanted them to arrive early to their classes.  So this was the plan. We would all wake up early in the morning and cook breakfast and have a family breakfast together.  It was decided that I would take the oldest son to his first day of kindergarten and see him off, and my wife would take the youngest to Pre-K. That way every one was on time and each child got the specialized attention they deserved. The plan was set, we explained to each of the boys what we were planning and they happily agreed. After breakfast, we each got to say our good byes to the boys and even the boys said goodbye to each other. It was rather emotional for everyone. We loaded our vehicles up and away we went.  As my oldest son and I arrived to the building, I could see the anticipation in his eyes.  He was very excited. As we entered the school, his excitement quickly turned to anxiety. He didn't want to go to the classroom.  I told him everything was going to be okay and I would see him after school.  I said ""Look at the friends you are going to make."" After a few minutes, he calmed down and saw all the other children already playing with the toys.  Out of the window, he could see the playground.  He soon became fearless and very excited and went in to hang his backpack.  I stayed for a few short minutes so I could remember this day forever.

I can't remember the last time I was consistently alone, well I can but it was about five years ago.  Their dad works full time and is almost never home, and never does anything related to school activities. The first day was crazy for me. I drove to my oldest son's school and got him settled with her and made sure he was comfortable and confident starting Kindergarten. I hightailed in out of there back to the car and got my youngest back in his seat and booked it to his school. Of course we live in a ridiculous town which hasn't done construction work all summer, yet they chose the first day of school to close down the roads surrounding two of our biggest schools. I was already rushing because my sons are supposed to be at their school 5 minutes apart and that's not even humanly possible, although I'll still always try. Finally got to my second son's school and got inside to find his teachers, get him all signed in and I just made it in time. I said goodbye and felt bad for all the parents whose kids were screaming, crying, hitting and straight losing their shit because they didn't want to leave their parents or go to school. My son just stood in line and walked out with his class and as he leaves he turns around and goes, you're going to come back right? What of course I'm going to come back I'll be here when the day ends to pick you up and then we'll go get your brother from his school and then get home. He walked out with his class and I left the building. All these other parents were crying and visibly upset about leaving their kids at school, I literally walked out the door, stood still for a moment and took a deep breath. I finally was alone, and it was going to happen again tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that. I felt guilty all the other moms were looking at me like I'm a lunatic because I'm relieved and not bawling my eyes out.

I was trapped in the middle of the woods after crashing my ATV. Somehow, someway, a flashlight from my ATV fell out, turned on, and pointed in my direction. It allowed someone to find me, and I was able to make a full recovery from my injuries in a few short months. I cannot imagine an event like that taking place in a world without the existence of God.

We were given a script of things we were to say during the short ceremony when the priest would do the introductions. He was to also say a prayer for our successfully completing the class. I had been told generally what to expect, but of course, it didn't go perfectly. Everything went well, except I got confused once about where I was supposed to say my little part of the script - but it worked out. I wasn't nervous, but I was deeply moved by this ceremony. It's really one of the things that has drawn me to the Catholic religion-the ceremony and sacredness of every little thing that is done. I love the music. The beauty of the church is striking. Anyway, we finished our little ceremony with few mistakes. We had walked up the steps at the alter to be closer to the priest, who isn't a young man and he's slightly limited in mobility. Turned out he wasn't going to come close to us, and our sponsors were to come around from behind to face us and do part of the blessing that the priest would have done. A bit clumsily, they inched around us and accomplished the task. Then it was over. We returned to our pew in the front and the Mass continued. Quite an experience.",3,A few Sundays ago our RCIA class did a short introduction ceremony at Sunday Mass. All went well with very few mistakes.

For that hour or more in church, I am me again and don't think of anything else besides my love of God at the time and that is all. I hope one day I will have the power to stand up to my step father in prison and say I forgive him. I want it to happen but I know I need time. Time is of the essence because as he rots in there, I am free. He took my freedom from me for a bit but slowly i am getting it back. It is hard for me to get in relationships with everyone because of the emotional frustrations I am caused. Mr Smalling is the light in my life to help fight through the pain.

Making the same thing for dinner two days in a row having forgotten she made that meal yesterday and then the sadness in her face when she is shown the leftovers from the previous day.  I think Mom was realizing it and trying so hard to fight the symptoms.  We went to the doctor who referred us to a specialist. The specialist prescribed medication and occupational therapy. While her symptoms are mild for the moment, she fixates on losing her quality of life. She worries about becoming a burden to us and also of being alone.  For me, I spend my time reassuring her while also researching the details of the disease. My kids do not know yet, and I stress about when and what to tell them.

There was little warning and no outward signs that definitively pointed to any form of dementia at all. Oh, there was the occasional forgetfulness and a few times the month before her diagnosis where she called me one day to tell me something and then called again three days later to tell me the same thing again. But that only occurred the month prior. My aunt and I compared notes that month and she had experienced the same thing and that was the first clue that anything was wrong. My mother retired to Florida about 20 years ago, my aunt lives in Ohio and I live in Texas and we get to see each other maybe once a year. My mother is 80 so she doesn't do email or text and she doesn't have a smartphone, just the old style flip phone with the big numbers on it. But we all talk to each other almost every week, that is, we used to talk to each other each week until this past March when we saw the first signs. Then April rolled around and that's the month of my birthday and she always calls on that day but this year there was no call. I let it pass and didn't think much of it until my aunt called me towards the end of April when we both realized neither of us had spoken to her for the entire month. We call my brother went over there and found her in bed pretty much incoherent, the condo was a mess and she mumbled something about falling. He took her to the hospital to get her checked out and the doctor said there were no signs of a stroke but he saw bruising on her hip, knee and arm and noted that he thought she probably had taken a bad fall so she stayed in the hospital for a few days under observation. The doctor told them she needed a walker because her knee was not supporting her weight very well and also advised them to have her schedule an appointment with her primary physician because she probably needed a brain scan to rule out other causes of her confusion. It was 3 weeks before she was able to get the brain scan and the confirmed diagnosis at that point was Alzheimer's. She was in a long term care facility within a month and she started losing ground fast. She no longer recognized anyone and she couldn't use the phone at all anymore so no more phone calls. After 2 months she quit eating and they had to put her in hospice which is where she remains today. She gets more attention there and has recovered at least some of the body weight she lost because she simply didn't experience or recognize hunger any longer. We've all learned several hard lessons around this development. Alzheimer's now runs in the family and all 4 of us kids now have an increased chance of being diagnosed with it. I'm 64 and I have to think about the burden that puts on my kids and my wife. 5 months ago? It didn't even register on my list of possibilities but Alzheimer's just changed my life and I don't even have it.

My mother took care of myself and small child so my husband could still work, we wouldn't have been able to make it through without her and I'm eternally grateful. I went back for the first follow up appointment and he removed the packing and stuck a light and suction tube in my sinuses and sucked out gobs and gobs of congealed blood.

It has been a very frustrating journey through the 'healthcare system'.Its been almost 6 months now and I continue to be hopeful that I can keep the polyps from coming back as science today doesn't seem to know why they form. Unfortunately, it really is up to me to figure out how my body works, what it needs to operate appropriately and perhaps find an Orthomolecular Doctor who can help me do so and treat me in a holistic fashion.

I have just come home from court, yet again. My daughter, Beth, has just be involved in another crime with this 'gang' she has been hanging out with the last few years. My wife is so depressed about she can't even be involved with it anymore. This all started when Beth started hanging out with the wrong crowd around the time she turned 16. We first felt she was just going through a 'rebellious stage'. We were patient at first and tried to be supportive. The first time we found drugs (marijuana), we were calm with her but told her we never wanted to see these kinds of things in the house again. When we saw her bring boys over, we were firm but caring about the situation. It only got worst. She started hanging out during all her free time with a certain crowd of people, some of them much older than her. Her grades began to slip and we got bad reports from her teachers. It wasn't too much of surprise when we received a call from Target security that they had caught our daughter shoplifting. We had to pay a big fine but they left her off without any charges. We were livid with her on the way home. Perhaps if were more understanding...Things improved (seemingly) for Beth following this incident. Her grades improved and she even made honor roll. We had high expectations that she would still be able to get into a good college after graduation. It's sad to remember that when she was younger she was always the brightest student in her class. After this latest incident everything is finished though. She was caught by the police dealing drugs at park. Apparently it was heroin. There is nothing we can do for her now. From what the police tell us, Beth has been leading a secret life as an inspiring drug kingpin the last year. They told us that she was in contact with certain groups in Mexico to supply her with more heroin so can increase her business in the coming year. We have no choice but to kick her out at this point.",3,"I have an 18-year old daughter who, academically, is very sharp.

My daughter moved out very quickly and went to live with my mother-in-law who lives about two miles away.   She is kind enough and claims to be ""non-judgmental"", but loves to dish out judgment whenever it suits her.  That said, my daughter thought this was a better way to live than to stay with us.  As she is 18, there is little we could do about that.  However, that doesn't change the fact that my wife and I were heartbroken about this situation.  But, we laid back and let her ""do her thing"" which, apparently, included quitting her job, something we would not have allowed.  (We require our children to work and help support themselves once they are old enough).  Generally speaking, she avoided contact with us, in spite of our efforts to be inviting and friendly.  We did our best to honor her wishes unless she contacted us.  We did get occasional negative feedback from my mother-in-law, which we ignored as best we could.  This was not how we wanted things to go for her, but as a teenager, she apparently knows better.  We were concerned that she would not continue with school (for which she has a full scholarship) or would do other ""dumb"" things.  All we could really do was sit back and wait.  Heck, even when she would come over to the house to see her sisters, she would only do so when my wife and I were not at home.  And, she would sneak away after we came back home.  It has been a distressing few months, to say the least. For many years we've had cats in our home, and our children grew up with those cats.  We had one pass away in late 2016, whom we missed greatly.  But of the two remaining cats, one had been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism two or three years ago.  We had been treating this with medicine and he seemed to have responded well overall.  However, in early October of this year, I found him under the bed of one of my other daughters and when I pulled him out, I realized that something was seriously wrong with him - it appeared he had had a stroke and was paralyzed and blind.  This cat was a much-beloved member of the family, and particularly to my daughters.  We took him to the vet who confirmed what we thought and had him put down.  It did break our hearts, but it did one thing that surprised us:  our daughter began coming around again when my wife and I were around and would at least say...something...to us, which we considered to be a huge improvement.",2,"I have an 18-year old daughter who, academically, is very sharp.

The 16 year olds are twins (just for the record).  In the middle of those, I have an 18 year old daughter.  She has always been fairly quiet and somewhat reserved, but has been a good kid and we rarely have had to worry about her.  She decided several years ago that she wanted to graduate from high school with an associates degree.  My wife and I both thought this was a great idea and we fully supported her in doing this, but we also advised here that it would be a lot of work. When she got to high school, she got right into it.  Initially, at least, she needed some help figuring out how to go about knowing what classes to take, etc.  She also couldn't start the ""early college"" program until she was a junior (11th grade).  She worked hard and put in a lot of effort between her 11th and 12th grade years.  We were very pleased to see what she was doing. This past April, she graduated with her associates degree in general studies (with honors) a month ahead of her high school graduation.  The following month, she graduated from high school with honors.   I was very proud of her and thought she had done an outstanding job.  We thought the future for her looked bright. A few weeks after her high school graduation, I discovered a number of messages on her instragram account, which were on a shared cell phone we use as the ""home"" phone.  The messages were between her and a relative and were extremely vulgar, crude and inappropriate.  My head hurt more than it ever had after reading these messages because my view of my daughter had changed and not for the better.  I was disappointed and distressed to have this happen. Shortly thereafter, in early June, while I was at work, she told my wife that she was leaving.  She packed up some of her things , walked out the door, and left.  I have not spoken to her since, although we know where she is.  I have been heartbroken about this and have not known what to do about the situation.

We decided to take a little road trip with them to Indianapolis to visit the children's museum and zoo for the weekend while they were here. The trip wasn't too far and the traffic wasn't bad either, we made pretty good time. The weather was nice for the entirety of the trip, mid 80's and sunny, nothing to complain about. The children's museum was quite interesting and had a ton of interactive things for the kids to mess around with. They looked to be having fun and were running from exhibit to exhibit to see everything the museum had to offer. After they had seen everything there we stopped at the cafe inside to grab some lunch before heading out of the museum and over to the zoo which was conveniently located nearby. The zoo was pretty big so we knew it would take up the remainder of the day, luckily it was only noon so we had plenty of time to see everything. We looked over the map of the zoo to see what we wanted to check out first, the kids wanted to see the large safari animals like the elephants and tigers so that's where we headed first. There was a vehicle you could board that would give you a drive by tour of the animals so we hopped on. We saw elephants, lions, zebras, giraffes and several other animals which the kids liked. They were pointing and trying to take some pictures with their phones. One of the elephants came extremely close to the vehicle and the children couldn't believe what they were seeing. To everyone's surprise, the elephant let out a loud sound that scared everyone, but the tour guide assured us that it was completely normal and to not be afraid. The children were laughing after it happened. After the ride we got off and walked around the rest of the zoo until my cousins' feet began hurting and we decided to call it a day. It was getting dark by then anyways and we left to go find a place for dinner. All in all it was a very good day that everyone enjoyed.

My husband was working second shift again at that time and so her party had to be on a weekend so that he should have the day off, but even that was not a promise. The weather was still cold enough at times that we knew it had to be an indoor party or we might get rained out. We ended up renting a building at one of the parks close by and decided to hold the party there. My dad and brother brought a heater over hours ahead of time so that we could warm up the building, even though the rules said we were not allowed to have a heater there, it was just too cold, so we watched it closely. My husband cooked BBQ pulled pork and shredded chicken for the guest and my mother made an amazing cake and cupcakes. The cake was a decorate rice-crispy treat and the cupcakes were chocolate, all were made to look like Minny Mouse. We noticed that we forgot a cooler for the pops but it was so cold out and there was snow on the ground still so we just set the cases of pop outside the door to the building. No reason to run back into town when nature was providing its own cooler for us.  My sister and one of her friends also showed up early to help decorate. A decent amount of people showed up but we all had a good time. My mom got her sugar glider out to show people and it ended up jumping on everyone's heads. It even jumped on my oldest and she freaked out and ran into a table. After making sure she was alright we found it kind of funny since sugar gliders are not dangerous animals at all. My youngest spent most of her time crawling around the building and being passed from one person to another but right after presents were opened and people were getting ready to leave she decided to surprise everyone and took a couple of steps. It wasn't much, but it was a start.

But it was a crazy coincidence that after I went to my neighborhood pool after work, swimming in the slow lane, next to a duck of all things (?) I got out of the pool and felt my water break. Like a cork pulled from a bottle of fizzy champagne. ( People have since asked how I knew. Water was already pouring down my legs. I would just tell them ""There is no mistaking a bottle of champagne uncorking between ones legs!"") I got right home, waddling like said Duck from the slow lane. Two slow blocks. I have been living with my Dad and Step-Mother, as you know Diary, and my Dad recalled my Mom's LABORS TO BE FAST, so he ignored my mid-wives reccommendation to call her when the contractions started coming closer together than they were ( 5 minutes, but what did I know?

I was scared, nervous, excited, ready, not ready... I didn't know what to feel, it was all so overwhelming. It had been a difficult pregnancy, I was sick for most of it and felt like it dragged on forever. I was excited the whole time, though, because I knew I was making someone that would be important to me for the rest of my life. I could not wait to meet the little person that I was creating. Once she was here, I was so tired and in pain but I was so happy. She was perfect and cute and healthy, I had been so worried she would be born with a defect or disability. But she was so perfect, fat and sleepy and a full head of dark curls. I didn't want the nurses to take her out of the room or out of my sight, I wanted her beside me forever. I didn't expect to feel anything like this, I never really had an interest in children and getting pregnant was a mistake. But as soon as I saw her, I loved her and only wanted to protect her and make her happy. I never expected to feel the amount of love and care and concern that I did feel. Pregnancy was a miserable, sick time for me, and birth was painful and exhausting and overwhelming, but it was all so worth it to make someone so cute and perfect that brings me so much happiness. I know I'm a better person now than I was before I had her, she's taught me so much patience and care and how to be unselfish.

That's all the time he had with his wife: 4 years of dating, 2 years of marriage, and then dead, with no kids to pass on his legacy, all because of a distracted driver. It made me so incredibly sad and also furious at how unfair life is. At the funeral we were encouraged to get up and say a few words. Some of his family did get up, but so did a few people that only seemed to be doing it to draw attention to themselves, like, ""I know he is dead, but have you thought about how *I* feel about it?"" which only made me more mad. Although I hate speaking in front of people, I did go up to talk about what he meant to me. I did not mention how I felt about the other hangers-on who got up to talk, because that would have been very inappropriate for a funeral, but instead tried to draw the focus back to what a wonderful human being this man was. How I never saw him angry, how I never saw him complain, how he always was so fun and jovial and approached each day like a blessing. Later on his wife told me how happy she was about my little speech. I felt glad I could support her.

I was a Criminal Justice student and pretty straight-laced, unbeknownst to me she was a struggling drug addict that was trying to turn her life around. We started smoking weed together. I like it a lot more now, but back then I wasn't too crazy about it. I just wanted to impress her and seem cool, because at the time I definitely felt like a kid in the relationship. Shortly after I started smoking with her, I started selling as well. She was one of my best and worst customers. I didn't have a lot of money at the time so I couldn't just give her free weed, but I'd sell to her either at my cost or taking a slight loss. I just couldn't keep up with her demand. That girl smoked A LOT. Eventually it got to the point where I had realized she was really just using me for the drugs, and I started to get extremely impatient about the money she owed me (again, keep in mind I was already selling to her at an amazing price because I liked her). Eventually this lead to me banging at her door at 3 A M trying to figure out just where the heck my money was. Her dad answered, and she wasn't too happy about that at all.

We laughed with each other the whole time. It was like old times. It was so good to feel that feeling again that we once shared together. It made we wonder why we both never tried making our relationship last. Throughout the day we grew closer to one another. She began to open up to me and we decided that we try and make it work out again. Now that we both know we want each other in our lives we made a promise that we would both give it our all. We decided to have some lunch, so I took her to the side of the park that had a nice view, laid a blanket down, and told her I would be right back with our food. I went to get our food and stopped by a booth that was selling flowers. I thought she would like it if I surprised her with them.

At that time, we had chatted for a while and then I had gone to visit her in New York City, where she was from, but a few weeks later, the brief beginning to a possible romance ended. I thought about her a lot over the next several months, and finally, about 5 months later, I contacted her again. I didn't know if she would respond, but to my delight, she did. However, emotions and feelings still had to be sorted out and ultimately we took a month or so break from communication again. It was then, in June, while about to take a week-long vacation to the beach with my family -- the travel route of which would take my by the town where she lived while going to school -- that we reconnected and planned to meet up on my way back from the beach. We decided to go to a theme park close by, one that I hadn't been to since I was probably in high school. All week I was excited and a bit nervous. Would this simply be two friends hanging out, or would it be something more? When I finally met up with her, things were a bit awkward at first; it had been a long time since we had seen each other and I was trying to feel out how to act. However, the next day when we went to the park, things were very fun and the conversation between us flowed naturally and easily. We even flirted and made some physical contact. We spent a long day at the park and rode all sorts of rides, and in the time we spend walking around and waiting in line, we talked a lot about each other and grew closer. At the end of the day, we went to her place -- both of us were pretty exhausted. While we were there, we talked intensely about the situation between us and really made a heart-to-heart connection. I told her I had wanted to kiss her all day but wasn't sure if I should. She responded that she had been waiting for me to do so. We sealed the day with a kiss, and since then we've been seeing each other almost every week.

It was an away game so we couldn't go to the actual game but we had the next best thing in watching it at the stadium with 20 thousand other fans.  My dad said he didn't want to go since he couldn't handle the stress of the game but i surprised him with tickets anyways.  This was a big deal for me since my dad is the reason I am into hockey and he had been watching the Blues his whole life and they have never won it.  I knew he would regret it if he just stayed home watching the game alone instead of having the chance to be downtown if we actually won it.  It was a stressful start of the game but luckily we scored first and never looked back. We looked like a team on a mission and that mission was to bring the Stanley cup to our town for the first time ever.  I could see my dad got a little more happy and less stressed with each goal we scored like he was starting to believe we might actually do it.  I was also freaking out inside because i knew we had been close before but always got let down and anything can happen in sports. Its never over until the final horn sounds so in the back of our minds we kept thinking the worst.  When they actually did it we went crazy with all the other people at the stadium but also I could see my dad crying a little. It brought me joy to know how happy he was in this moment and i was glad i was here to share it with him.  This is something we will continue to talk about for years to come and we will always know where we were when it happened.  He brought me to a game 7 in the world series when i was young so this was also a way for me to repay the favor but i hope to repay it again sometime in our lifetime with an actual game ticket.  To be in that stadium though when the whole city felt like they won was a great memory to have and one that I will be forever grateful i shared with my dad.,3,I took my dad to a game 7 watch party for the Stanley cup.

I rushed to the police station,at least i was relieved the conman was under police custody ,will not give fake promises to anyone again. The police confronted him to reveal whereabouts of my documents and how he has been operating. He begged like a little baby that it was not his fault and that what he did to me and other victims was as a result of poverty and need for cash to feed his family. He confirmed that  he threw the documents away as they had no use to him. I met with other victims who appeared to be fresh graduates like me. Police were able to get information on which technique he used as he was targeting graduates with no exposure to the corporate society. The conman was presented into a court of law and was sentenced for fifteen years. I was so happy at least the victim will be in prison for long after putting innocent people in such a tormenting experience.

It was Jessica, a woman that I had dated years ago until she had to move out of the state for work. We hadn't seen each other since then so it was a shock to find her in my neighborhood. We had a quick conversation in the store and we got caught up on our lives a bit and she said she moved back to help care for her sick father. When I found out she was single I took a chance and invited her out on a date the next night and she agreed. We went to a movie and saw a new romantic comedy that she heard was good and we enjoyed it. Afterwards we stopped at an Italian restaurant and had a great conversation and things felt like she had never left. We went back to my apartment after dinner for a couple of drinks. We got comfortable on the couch and I put on The Boys since she mentioned that she wanted to see it during dinner. We were both asleep before the first episode ended though.

We have spent so much money and time on this. We got there around 6am, traffic was shockingly less than expected!

We then saw the kids he would be competing against and felt a pang of nerves, how could this little kid compete against kids much bigger and stronger than him?! He did not seem phased at all. Another boy and his family were there but they were not remotely friendly, they kept glaring at us which made me feel irritated and also nervous. One of Ben's friends, a little girl skated and did ok but did not win, she came 4th in her event. This made me worry for Ben and start telling myself this whole trip was a waste of money. It was time for Ben to skate and we all held our breath, he did an amazing job and we were not sure if it was good enough to win but it was good. Ben's coach said ""he has got this, he will win"" and we waited for the scores, trying to not get too excited. The scores took forever to be announced but when they were, sure enough, he had won!

My coworker, Ray, and I had been working on it really hard together. It was a collaborative project, neither of us could have done it alone, but we were also kind of competing. We knew that management was monitoring our progress and that the open Supervisor position would probably go to whichever one of us appeared to be the highest performer. I felt as if I had done really well, contributing most of the labor to the project. However, Ray also did a good job of keeping everything organized. I guess I demonstrated more work ethic, but he demonstrated better project management skills. I say ""I guess"" because here we are, three months later, and Ray is the new supervisor. I'm not really upset, although I am a little disappointed. After working with him on this project I do like and respect him, both as a coworker and as a leader. Obviously I wish I had gotten the promotion instead though. I will probably remember this incident, so I can bring it up at my next performance review. I will ask management if there was something in particular that affected their decision, and if so, are there any suggestions on how I can improve. I will also ask if there are any alternative routes for my advancement, since Ray has taken this open position. Who knows, maybe now that Ray is a Supervisor, he's privy to the behind the scenes action that led to this decision. I think I will ask him about it, and see if he knows why he was picked over me. I'll make it clear there are no hard feelings, and maybe he can help me improve so that I will be the top candidate next time around.",1,I was excited to receive a promotion at work.

It was so nice just to be in his arms again and smell his cologne. The last night I was there was the best. He surprised me with dinner on the beach and the meal did not disappoint. He made fresh seafood pasta with Alfredo sauce, salad, and homemade rolls. We sipped on our favorite craft beer while we set at the little table he had set up. The most memorable part was the walk we took after supper along the shoreline. The tide was starting to come ashore and he stopped and gave me a gentle kiss.

Over the course of the year, I made several friends, one of whom invited me to visit him in his hometown of Ormond Beach over the Fourth of July weekend. We left on Thursday and arrived later that night, taking in a fireworks show before retiring for the evening. The following day, we visited a friend of the family at his home just out of town. He owned a fairly large amount of property which he used, in part, as a gun range. While neither my friend nor I are particularly pro-gun, my friend studies World War II history and owns a number of historic weapons that he wanted to operate. So we spent much of the day there until poor weather forced us indoors. Once the storms cleared out, we went back outside to take in a private fireworks show of questionable legality. The following day, we spent some time exploring Daytona Beach. We visited a few shops and my friend showed me a few of the more interesting sights. Later, we returned to Ormond and checked out the Rockefeller house. That night, we went to the race at Daytona Speedway. My friend's family owns property near the track and consequently has some connections, so we were able to tour the raceway prior to the race. Unfortunately the race was rained out, but it was still a memorable time. The following day, we returned to Gainesville, but prior to leaving, we decided to visit the beach. I spent almost my entire life in Ohio, and Gainesville, while obviously much closer to the sea, is still landlocked, so this marked the first time I got to see an ocean.

We participated in a number of activities, including a Nascar race (which was postponed, unfortunately). On Friday, we visited a friend of my friend's family. My friend, though liberal, collects old firearms, and the guy we visited owns an outdoor range. So we spent some time there firing off different weapons before ""enjoying"" a private, amateur fireworks show.  But the final day was most memorable. Ormond is right on the Atlantic coast, so on the way back, we decided to stop and spend some time on the beach. I've lived in Ohio for most of my life, only moving down to Florida last year. And since I'm in central Florida, I'm not overly close to the ocean. So this was the first time since I was very little that I had seen the ocean. We walked along the beach for a bit and chatted. The conversation wasn't overly memorable, but I found the walk very relaxing and enjoyable. I enjoyed the trip as a whole, but we tried cramming a lot of events in a short period of time, so things got a bit chaotic at points. The beach walk was easily the most relaxing part, and a really nice way to end the weekend. We probably spent an hour and a half or so walking along the beach. Once the sun started going down, we departed. I would be fine writing about this in the future.",1,"Over the weekend of the Fourth of July, I visited a friend in his hometown of Ormond Beach, Florida.

I had nothing to do really except for laundry but there's always laundry. I have a 14 month old and she's very messy. I came back from the laundry room to check my phone, I'm always on there it's my only source of entertainment. I saw that I had a missed call from Dan, I thought huh what did John do now. I checked my voicemail and this time it wasn't what did John do, it was what had happened to him. I found out John was in the ICU and on life support and that Dan asked me if I wanted to come with him to the hospital because the doctors had requested he come, he was the emergency contact.  I had my sister come watch my daughter while I went with Dan to the hospital. John was there, intubated and sedated and they said that he isn't going to die but they had to intubate him because they had to sedate him, he was combative with them when they were trying to help him he was also put in restraints so he couldn't fight anymore or try to hurt the nurses and doctors. I had told the doctor what I know about John and his problem with drugs and mental health I told them it was probably a suicide attempt, even had a notebook with a suicide note written for me, actually had that for a while no date on it. After his stay in the ICU he was taken to the psychiatric unit where he stayed a month and got treated for his major depression and also PTSD. I was hoping this would change him and he actually agreed that if this didn't nothing would. Unfortunately months after the incident nothing has except for my patience, it's gone and my hope is gone to. There's nothing I can anymore I tried everything possible to help him threw this. Years of me helping him. Everything besides actually forcing him and you can't do that to a person because they have free will but I can't do anymore for him.

When we arrived and got off the airplane we went to rent a car but because we were not from the country we had a hard time. We would have no idea how to even drive a car in Croatia because they drive on the other side of the road. Because of this we tried to take an uber to the hotel for the night but we got lost. Trying to talk to the uber driver was hard! He didn't speak english so our friends got out and tried to find another driver. We opted for a ride share and when the driver came to pick us up we all piled inside. After being in the car for a few minutes, another passenger got in. We couldn't believe our eyes! It was the singer of our favorite band, the one we would be seeing the next day! It turns out he was staying at the same hotel as us and we got his autograph when we got out of the car at the hotel.

My friends and I had tickets to ultra music fest and decided that a road trip would be the most fun way to go. The ride should have lasted about 9/10 hours give or take. We left the hotel in Germany at around 6 in the morning, we didnt want to drive to late at night because we would have been tired. We were on the road for about 5 hours when the car we were in experienced a flat tire. Luckily for my friends and I we all know how to change a tire so we got out the car and went to change the tire but there was no extra tire. We were stuck with no service in the middle of no where. We tried calling the rental car company and tried calling for help but there was no connection. My friends and I decided to walk back about 4 miles to where we saw a gas station to call for help. About an hour later we were at the gas station but there was no one there, and we still had no phone service. We decided to stay at the gas station for some time hoping that someone would show up. 4 hours later with no service and still waiting for help we decided to walk back to the car. 30 minutes after walking towards the car we saw a huge van start to head towards us, we jumped up and down for help and the van stopped and a musician who was playing at the same venue we were going to got out the van with his security. My friends and I explained the situation and they gave us a ride to the venue and backstage passes it was amazing. Before we got to the venue we were able to call the rental car company and they tracked the car to pick it up and return it to us.

When I saw her on the street, and asked her about why she took off on her wedding day, her first line of defense was that she forgot to feed her cats. Staring right to her face, I knew she was lying.  I questioned it, and she just went into a remorse/emotion state and quickly told me the actual reason. She didn't have a cat. The real reason was because she was questioning her sexuality, and the wedding day was just the necessary straw to break the camel's back. It was quite a shocker for us. We did not know she was a bisexual and had a girlfriend on the side. Apparently she didn't know the extent of her love until the day of the wedding. We wondered if the groom knew as well.  While I was not a close friend of hers, I was not well known of her sexual preference. While I do not think it was a good idea to run away during wedding day, I do not agree with a wedding where vows are made and the infidelity would have started from day 1. I then followed up with what's her plan now. She plans to move away from the town within the next month. She dumped both the groom and the girlfriend soon after her fiasco. She just wanted a fresh start. She also went to the full extent of changing her number as she was getting unwanted calls for being a *itch for running away.

When my father died, it hurt me and my family. My father was fairly young when he died at the age of 47. It was a hard time for everyone after he passed away. My father died about 6 months ago due to diabetes. He was a diabetic for a long time, but then he had a stroke, and it made his condition even worse. My father was a healthy man a few years back, but he liked to drink alcohol.. mainly beers. After work, he would always drink a few beers to relax. After my father had the stroke, he past away a few months after. It really hurt me to see him die fairly young, and it devastated my family. I could not function properly after he died, and it left me depressed. It left me to a point where I started drinking myself, just to let the pain go of him not being here anymore. I had to tell myself that drinking was not the answer, and he would want me to move on, and continue to make him proud by being successful in life. It was a very painful time in my life.

It took me a moment to comprehend what she was saying. She went on to tell me her mother had purchased a vacation package for the two and now her mother wasn't going to be able to go. My sister-in-law really needed a traveling companion and since we got along well and often had fun together I decided to go. It was a very long flight but the time passed quickly since we always found things to talk about. We both love french food and pastry so we made plans to eat whatever we wanted and just have fun. It was a gray rainy day when we arrived but I didn't mind that at all. In fact the rain and dark clouds seemed to make Paris just like I had seen it in so many movies. I was overwhelmed with the different smells, sights and sounds. After we checked into our hotel and freshened up we decided to go immediately to see the Eiffel tower first. It was within walking distance and the rain was just a light drizzle so we grabbed a couple of umbrellas and made our way down the noisy sidewalk in the direction we thought we should be headed. I was beginning to think we had made a wrong turn when suddenly my sister-in-law pointed up ahead and there in the distance I could see the top half of the Eiffel tower silhouetted against the gray sky. It was a lot bigger than I had imagined it would be. As we approached the base of the tower I noticed the age of the construction and I thought of the history that had passed while the beautiful tower had stood gracefully for so long. I stood looking up at the tower in a light drizzle of rain while people made their way here and there with not even a glance toward the tower they were so accustomed to living near. It was a wonderful way to to start our vacation in Paris at the base of the Eiffel tower.",1,The story is about how I got to go to Paris.

They showed us around, what the best places to visit were etc. After that, we went to actually visit some of those places! There was this museum (I forgot what it was called) I thought that is was really cool. The next day we went to see what I had been wanting to see from the beginning, the eiffel tower! We got up, headed to it and got to see it finally. It was so amazing to see it, it was bigger in person than I thought it would be. I took as many pictures as I could.

Standing next to me is a man and his son, who appears to be at most 10 years old. They had Harvick shirts on.  The two of them are getting their stuff ready to be signed, as the dad pulls out a die-cast car and hands the kid a picture. As Kevin comes towards us, the kid holds the picture out for Kevin to sign. It is as this point that I see the picture in all of its glory. Kevin takes the picture, sees what’s on it, and starts laughing. He says in between laughs, “I was wondering when I was going to sign this picture.” He signs the picture, then takes off his hat, signs it, and puts on the kid’s head.

I was at the restaurant, after I placed an order for what we wanted and had a little gist and chat while there.

She was still a bit confused, but began to sort through the different sizes to find hers (a 5.5). To her dismay, there was no size 5.5 ring on the key chain! I pretended to be a bit confused before reaching deeper into the cup and pulling out a much smaller red Kevin Main Jewelry box. I got down on one knee, I was very much happy on that day.

Having grown up in small city in Texas, the heart of football country, I was familiar with boys like him. It was just my luck to have moved over a thousand miles away and still fall for someone who would have been at ease growing up in my hometown. I enjoy a good football game, but I'm not the type to go out to the stadium every Sunday. And with our home team spending the last several seasons, guarding the bottom of the standings, I made it clear that I would only go to games on a special occasions.  Having lived with my boyfriend for over a year and half, I could feel when something in our routine seemed to shift. I noticed he was on the phone more with his best friend. He normally took his calls in his little office/man cave, rarely closing the door. In fact, I'm more likely to close it when he gets too noisy. Sometimes, you just can't help yourself. So many times I walked by his office and would be completely oblivious to what he was talking about. But this time a few weeks ago, I heard him say, ""That ring is going to be perfect."" And that stopped me right in my tracks. Unfortunately those words were at the end of his conversation.  I back tracked to his office and tried to get some more information from him, but he would only say that he was ""just"" talking to his best friend. Sensing I was going to get anything else out of him with letting on that I may know something, I retreated from his office. I really didn't know how to feel at that moment. We both love each other and there were no real issues between the two us. It was just marriage was not something we'd spoke about yet. A little while later, I was in the kitchen making a smoothie for lunch, when he came strolling in. He seemed a bit nervous (or excited, still really can't figure which it was). He asked me if we had any plans the following Sunday. After confirming on our day-planner that we were free, he said to block the day for a football game. I readily agreed. Fast forward to the game and me watching his best friend propose to his girlfriend of 3 months at half-time.",2,I went to a football game with my boyfriend.

I really had it in my mind that he was finally going to propose to me! I spent a few hours getting ready in advance. I took a shower, got my favorite clothes together, and did both my makeup and my hair. There was no way I was going to waste this moment. I spent the rest of the afternoon fantasizing about the big moment: maybe we would end up on that huge screen they advertise; or maybe he had something crazy planned, like a flash mob. I know it sounds silly, but my mind was running wild. A weird mix of nervousness and excitement fluttered in my chest. When it was time to head out to the game, I almost expected John to be in a nice suit and clean-shaven. I walked downstairs to meet up with him and found that he was wearing his typical fan jersey and he was wagging a huge #1 finger around excitedly. My heart sank, and I realized that, maybe, I was wrong. I was shocked! Suddenly felt kind of stupid being all dolled up. John jokingly told me I was way overdressed, and I grumbled something about how I thought he was going to propose to me tonight. He looked surprised, and his face changed. John told me that he will propose eventually, but I need to let things happen more organically. He wants it to be a surprise, and if I was able to guess it so easily, the experience might not be the same. At first, I was pretty upset and I couldn't figure out what he was talking about but I thought about it a little bit and realized he was right. This wasn't the first time I tried to push the situation, and I guess I was being a little overzealous about getting married. I hugged him, and went back upstairs to change into a matching team jersey. We ended up going on a fun date, and it all worked out in the end.",1,I went to a football game with my boyfriend.

The changes in routines and friends are a large part of that hardship for me.,"In a few days, it will be five months since I lost my dream job. This was the job I worked towards my entire career as a chemist. As an investor funded company, I knew it could end at any time, but the company had just received the promise of another two years of funding. Our research was going well and we were meeting deadlines. The day that changed my life started as any other day at work. I was told there would be an impromptu meeting at the end of the day but that wasn't anything out of the norm. Unfortunately, I could not stay for the meeting as my 4 year old had swim practice on Wednesday evenings and I came in early to be able to take her. Everyone in that meeting was told to pack up their desks that evening and not to return. The funding that was promised was not going to happen and they could not afford to keep the staff for one more day. Since I was not at the meeting, I received my news by phone call, while sitting in the parking lot of the local rec center. I was told by HR to return the following day to collect my belongings and that there would be no severance package. It was so devastating of a loss that I could not focus on the task at hand of taking my daughter in for her lesson. The rest of the evening feels like a blur of events. All I can remember is going through the motions to make it to bedtime and getting on my computer to scour job postings. However, the city I live in is far more technology oriented and there were very few science oriented job postings. I started to become depressed and worried about our livelihood. I had only been with the company for a few months and already changed our lives for this job. I switched my daughter's preschool to be closer to my work and it was now a 30 minute commute from our home, with a few months left of the school year. I had also booked a cruise vacation with the extra income this job was providing and felt stressed about making the payments with only one income. The friends I made with my new co-workers were still too new that I didn't have a single one of them on social media. I also wasn't there for the final meeting and that left me without a means of gaining their contact information. I grieved for their loss as well. I knew the hardships a few of my single co-workers were going through and felt lucky that I had my husband to fall back on. This loss was one of the hardest I've encountered but it also brought about such wonderful change. I switched careers to substitute teaching and not being in a lab meant it was safe to have another baby.",2,"The life-changing event of a job loss is never easy.

I've worked at this store for so long, and became so familiar with my coworkers, the daily routine, the customer's, etc.  My coworkers and I all supported each other through the process since it was new for all of us. We took turns running the registers, helping as many customer's as we could, and trying to get as much merchandise out of the store asap. The most difficult and tiresome part of all of this is dealing with the customer's. Their reactions to hearing about the store's closing ranged from disbelief, confusion, annoyance, anger, and panic. You would think that the world was ending by the way they responded to the news. We tried to explain to them as much as we understood ourselves (we all had little scripts to read to them, disclosing very little information), but they still pressed on wanting to know why. The most memorable experience I had was during the last week of the closing. The store was closed to customers, and we were putting things palettes and wrapping things up. The store was very empty, and we knew our time was winding down together. So we decided to all stop what we were doing, and stood in a circle and played catch with a tennis ball we found on the ground.  We just tossed it among each other, and what seemed like a simple thing was actually the best experience we had throughout the whole treacherous process. It was a time that we actually just stopped and enjoyed each other's company, laughed, and shared stories about the past time's we had in the store. Our manager's didn't yell at us our make us stop. I think we all understood that this experience was special, despite all of the obstacles, difficulties, and challenges we faced.",3,"The life-changing event of a job loss is never easy.

I knew that from that point on everything will change. I started out as a regular sales associate. I moved my way up the ranks over the years.

I've gotten so used to working there, my coworkers, and the familiar faces of the customers. However, I knew it was time to move on, I just needed a push to do it. I feel like everything happens for a reason, and maybe this was some higher power forcing me to move on. The experience was very new to me. I've never been through a store closing and liquidation before. It's an experience that I'll never forget. You try to stay positive in this bittersweet moment. It's a weird feeling watching day-by-day, the physical look of the store change. It gets emptier and emptier. Products are being marked down to prices as low as you've ever seen.

Once we found a place of our own, I had to tell my current roommate about my intentions to move out. I gave her 7 weeks notice, which is quite a generous amount of time given the legal obligation in most states of only 30 days. She had initially received it pretty well, but left abruptly about an hour after I told her. She came back drunk in the middle of the night and proceeded to bang on my door while I was sleeping saying that we needed to talk. She then proceeded to tell me how I wasn't a good friend and how a decent person would have ""given her all the time she needed to find a new roommate."" Among the laundry list of disparaging comments was the insult that I was effectively screwing her over while she was attempting to extort several months rent out of me. After doing a bit of legal homework, I learned that she had no leverage against me and told her I was only obligated to give her 30 days notice. She blew up my phone with phone calls and text messages insulting and demeaning me and I haven't made direct contact with her since. I had since been staying at my girlfriend's house during the transition and when I first returned to my apartment in the following weeks I found all of my belongings that were in the shared common area had been ransacked and shoved into my room. The irony of this, was that my roommate said that she did not trust me with her belongings, but she felt she had the right to go through my things. Upon inspection, I found that all of my books were removed from the living room bookshelf and tossed onto my bed. Another time I returned to find that all of my kitchen belongings that I intended to pack up were thrown casually on the floor. Later the same night I got a text message from my former roommate saying that she expected me to clear out ASAP despite still being within the thirty day period of rent that I paid for my last month. The situation has escalated to a point where I no longer feel comfortable associating with this person face to face and have taken active measures to avoid her at all costs.

This tension carried on throughout their lives, and it all came to a head when my sister married Mark.  My brother in law was a good man, however my mother did not agree with his atheist views, as she had been very religious her entire life.  I feel that my mother resented him for influencing my sisters religious views, which had become non existent over the past few years.  She stopped going to church and stopped showing up for family dinners on the holidays, which was something we did normally at least once a month.  The older you get, the more difficult it becomes to release grudges and judgments towards people.  My mother was open minded to listening what Mark believed in and why he did not believe in god, however those intentions faded as Mark’s situation got worse.  After finding out he had cancer, his attitude towards life began to change, and my mother sensed this.  She decided she did not want to be part of the negativity that surrounded my sisters family at the time, and felt it would have impacted her own religious beliefs.  	I understand why my mother distanced herself from the situation due to her relationship with god, however, life is short and I feel she regrets not visiting my sister and her husband before his death.  My mother put god before her family and has expressed to me she does feel guilty for not visiting Mark, but told me she could not sacrifice her life long commitment to Christianity.  Sometimes in life if we are going to be better people, we have to make sacrifices for others even if they make us feel uncomfortable.",2,My sister's husband passed of cancer within the last year.

My mother still doesn't really reach out to my sister on her own to see how she is doing even though my mother should know exactly how she is feeling having lost her husband a year and a half ago. One of the more brutal things she said to my sister was that at least she had her two daughters at home to help and she had no one. My sister really wanted to reply that my mother had her husband for 20 more years than she did but did not want to stoop to her level. Whenever they do speak on the phone, it generally ends with my sister being upset by something my mother did or didn't say to her. I try to be supportive of both of them but it is very difficult. I always read that death brings out some interesting sides of your family but never guessed it would be this devastating to live through. I pray it gets better but in reality think it will end up that they continue to not speak to each other that often. I feel put in the middle of a situation that is out of my control. My other sister is just as bad about not being supportive. She told me that our other sister was never really a sister to her. This escalated during our parents anniverary celebration 8 years ago. There was a heated exchange between the two of them. Unfortunately that was the dagger in the coffin that caused them not to talk to each other for a long time. There was a lot of tension at my dad's funeral and some pretty awful things were said. Neither of them will see the other side and try to make amends.

Last October, she lost her husband to a long battle with pancreatic cancer. He was only 57 and had been suffering for three and a half years. The came six months after our Dad had passed from complications due to a stroke. This summer was particularly challenging for my sister as my Dad's birthday and her anniversary was in July so she was very sad. When I called my sister on her anniversary to let her know I was thinking of her, she told me she had not even heard from our mother was very hurt by that as our mother, out of everyone, should have known how my sister was feeling that day. Whenever I would speak to my sister, she would be upset about something our mother had said to her. For example, in trying to go through paperwork, my mother would say to her, ""at least you have your girls to help, I have no one"". It's hard for me to even think our mother could be so harsh because my sister's husband died so young whereas my dad was in his 80's and had lived a great life. This insenstivity extended to our younger sister, who instead of offering her support, chose to bring up an event that happening 8 years ago at our parent's 50th anniversary. It escalated earlier this summer over text messages with some very vile things said to each other and they are no longer speaking to each other. In fact, my younger sister tried to get me to take her side when I went for a visit for her son's graduation. Thankfully, my younger sister's husband told her that she should not drag other people into her fight with my older sister. It was heartbreaking to her that our mother and younger sister are that insensitive to my older sister and what she is going through.

I was grateful for the gift, but passed it off as something I wouldn't do because I don't really believe in psychics or fortune tellers. Three years went by and about three months ago, a friend from my gym was talking about a medium they went to and how much fun it was. I remembered that I had been gifted that session after Hank passed away and got to think about going myself. I scheduled it for the following Friday and was pretty skeptical on what would go on. I figured it would be in a poorly lit room and woman with a bandanna would come out and grab my hand and ask a lot of personal questions then give me a bunch of hokum about the spirit world and lights would flicker and so forth. I figured it would maybe be a fun story to tell at parties. So i get there and this nice young woman, Janice, greets me at the door. We exchange pleasantries and she leads me around the corner to a big red sofa and we both sit down on it and she asks me why I was there, so I told her about my friend Hank, dying three years ago and wondered if he could be contacted. She asked a couple of simple questions about how long ago we met and where then we just began to talk. Not about anything in particular just things. As the conversation went on something amazing happened. Janice grabbed hold of my hand and looked me straight in the eyes and told me about the first time Hank and I met back in high school, and asked if I remembered it. I was dumbfounded. How could she have known that. I told her I did and then she kept talking about things Hank and I did as teenagers and places we went and it was just like talking to Hank. I could not believe it. We started talking about things that he was going through right before he died and how he thought everything would be alright and that he would be watching me to make sure I was not doing anything wrong and things like that. I was amazed at how it all turned out. I thanked Janice and asked her how she does it and she says, she doesn't know, that ""it just happens"". It was incredible. I have recommended Janice to several people over the last three months just to see if they have the same experience I did, and they all have.

At the start of the session, I admit I was skeptical. The only reason I was doing it is because it was gifted to me; it wasn't something I would have sought out myself. While I've always been a person who believe in spirits and energy living beyond death, someone actually communicating in real time with someone I'd lost was not something I fully believed in. I have to admit that going into the session, my expectations were fairly low. However, it didn't take more than 10 minutes for my entire outlook to change. After telling the medium who it was I wanted to speak to, they kicked off the process to communicate with them. Without going into too much detail, I can say that within the first few minutes of the conversation, I was sure I was speaking to my friend. One thing that the medium said caused me to burst into tears—my friend knew of the symbol we had created for her after her death. I was also finally given some sort of confirmation that my friend was happier where she was. She said that I didn't need to worry about her, and I was told that she spends time with me sometimes. It's been 3 years since she died, but nothing gave me more relief than this session did. It doesn't make the pain of the death go away, but it absolutely helped with the healing process. I regret now that I waited for so long to take the session out of fear of what I'd hear, because after the fact, I feel that it was the best decision I could have made. I'm so grateful that I even had the opportunity to something like that. I got a sense of closure that many aren't lucky enough to have, and it made a profound difference on my general outlook.",3,"After a close friend of mine died, I was gifted a session with a medium.

I've had this session for a while (it was a gift) but it took me almost 3 years post-death to scrape up the courage to actually do it. I was skeptical, absolutely—I do believe in spirits and that our energy has to go somewhere after death, but that's a far leap to actually communicating with a dead person. So, going into it, I was honestly more scared that it was going to work than that it wouldn't. The first few questions he asked me were basic—said that he was seeing a father figure and asked me if a grandfather of mine had died. Being my age, it's fairly reasonable to assume that at least one of my grandfathers are dead (both are) and as I wasn't particularly close to mine, as he was talking about him, I was starting to write the psychic off as a phony. However, then he asked me if there was someone specific I wanted to contact, and of course, there was; I asked him to bring my friend forward by repeating her name multiple times. Immediately, things felt different. He started pulling out details about her death that were 100% accurate, and while I was definitely getting closer to believing him, I still wondered if he had researched my social media in depth or taken the time to do a deep search on people in my life. But as we went on, he started recalling things that there were absolutely no way he could have known. He pulled memories out, he described the streets I walk on on my way to work (where apparently, my friend walks alongside me sometimes). He talked about her parents, about how she feels now that she's in a different place, and asked about our other mutual friends. At this point, I was pretty convinced (and emotional, of course). It wasn't until he pulled out a very specific detail—something that had only taken place in a private setting after my friend had already died—that I absolutely lost it and started sobbing; I knew it was real. I was somewhat in shock; I was essentially communicating with someone that I was sure I would never have the chance to again. The session was only 45 minutes long, and I wish I could have had longer, but it provided me with a sense of closure that I hadn't felt in years. It made me sad, for sure, but it also made me happier, and it felt like I was relieving a burden.

A person's career determines their lifestyle both in terms of time and resources available for leisure. Many people also derive a lot of their identity from what they do for work or a career. There are also many industries where a lifestyle may be tied up in a career. For instance, folks that work in the alcohol industry have a pretty specific lifestyle that tends to correspond to their choice of career. Ideally people would be made up of more than just the careers they've chosen but all too often you find folks that seem to have cobbled together an identity based on what they expect people expect of them. In my mind, the most interesting people are folks that have very different careers and lifestyles that sometimes combine in surprising ways. As much as I kind of detest Elizabeth Gilbert, I listened to a talk that she gave about people with different styles of going through life. Some who are incredibly driven and work towards a singular goal but are frankly rather boring. And then there are those that flit from thing to thing and develop a diverse skill set and may not have a huge singular accomplishment but are likely super interesting. There is also a lot to be said for getting out of one's comfort zone. If we only interact with people in a similar career to ourselves, we risk missing out on the upsides of diversity. The same can be said for lifestyle.  If you only hang out with people that have a similar lifestyle, you won't learn much or experience many new things. Especially in cases where a lifestyle is harmful it can be really good to experience folks living in a different way.",4,"life style and career is title for the paragraph I say,In life we are meeting every day too much of type of people and their life stylecareer also the same type",90.0,0.02696332490692536,,0.012453934551861797,0.016337029181886464,0.025912220764439553,0.023740792693570257,,-0.014509390355063564,-0.010626295725038898,-0.0010511041424858085,-0.0032225322133551046,301,15,4.651162790697675,0.584717607973422,26,20.066666666666666,0,5,5,0,2

We were on the interstate driving home, when my dad starts to tell me a story about a time when he was in the Army. I forget the precise details, but it was basically about how he and some buddies went out on the town one evening and had a few drinks. ... The tale becomes a bit more serious and personal all of the sudden  like he's pouring his heart out to me. My dad then says that he and his friends ran into another group of guys and got into an argument. The fight supposedly turned physical, with my dad throwing some punches at one of these guys. Then my dad, in the most serious tone possible, tells me that he grabbed the guy and pushed him off a cliff. The guy died and my dad and his friends managed to cover up the whole sordid tale from the police — this was the first time he'd ever admitted it to another living soul outside of that night. At this point, I'm horrified. Is my dad just confessing a murder to me? Was this mild-mannered man radically different when he was a 20-year-old kid? Do I tell my mom? Do I tell the police? Do I ask him to stop the car? Finally something in the story actually sunk in the part about 'pushing him off a cliff.' My dad was stationed in Louisiana when he was in the military and while I'd never been there, I was pretty sure there weren't that many cliffs. I finally said, ''Wait a minute, a cliff?' I'd been avoiding even looking at him since he made his 'confession,' but now that I looked over, he was about ready to explode.

They live a couple hours away and I was leaving on a Friday night after getting off from work. I had the following week off for Christmas and planned to stay with my family. When I left from work that night, it was almost 8 p.m. and was already dark. My parents live in a secluded area which is pretty dark with a lot of forest around them. It's very beautiful during the day, but reminds me of something out of a horror movie at night. I had my high beams on most of the way since there aren't many cars on the road out there, especially late at night. And since the roads aren't very well lit the high beams help. I was also pretty tired since I left work late that night and wanted to be extra safe. Unfortunately it wasn't safe enough as I hit a deer that night and ran into a ditch. I'm not sure where the deer came from, well actually it probably came from the forests surrounding the roadway. But I never saw it coming. I hit the deer straight on and it smashed my windshield before I flew into the ditch. I remember seeing blood on my windshield before I ran into the ditch, I thought it was mine for the split second that I was still in control of my car. My car was totaled, but I was okay. I had some bruises and was in some pain, but didn't break anything. Fortunately all of this happened not too far from my parent's home so I called them and they were able to call the police and come with them pretty quickly. Since the accident, and my near death experience, I've had a different outlook on life. I've made a career change and I've decided to move closer to my family. Not because I'm afraid of driving long distances at night, but because I've realized life is too short and I want to spend it with my family and doing something I love. I don't want to be stuck in a dead end job for the next 30 years until I retire. I'm planning to go into business for myself, but I'm not quite sure what I'm going to do yet.",2,"I was in a car accident with a deer.

My sister and I lay still for a moment, immobilized by shock and fear. I then quickly unbuckled my seat belt and checked on my sister, who was also wearing her seat belt. She was safe. Besides having some minor whiplash, I was also safe. This event has been reiterated in my mind dozens of time since it took place. I wonder what would have happened if my sister or I was seriously hurt or killed. I contemplate the fragility of life and existence.

I experienced a similar event.,"I can relate to this because while I wasn't admistted to a psychiatric ward, I did suffer depression about 25 years ago.  I had just broken up wtih my long-time boyfriend (who I was in a long-distance romance with for the last year of our relationship) and the breaking up was not of my doing. At that point in time, I was prepared to move back to his state (California) and we were to get married.  He decided he no longer wanted that even though he still loved me.  So, here I was, in the Midwest, just having quit my job and thinking, ""now what""?  I fell into a deep depression that was only quashed by some one-on-one therapy sessions (and after that didn't work), a visit to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with clinical depression.  At that time, anti-depressants weren't all that available but I was prescribed one and took it for 6 months.  A horrible situation in my life but I got better and moved on.  Although I moved on, when describing my inner self to a friend, I say that something in me died.  I'm fine; I laugh; I enjoy a good time with friends, but there's a part of me that died with that experience and I have never gotten it to come back to life.  I feel that I am an ""almost whole"" person but not quite complete as a result of that time in my life.  I don't wish it on anybody.  I can completely empathize with the summary above.  I know what it is like to experience depression.  It is a horrible place to be in, mentally.  But the good news is that there is help, even for those who fall into the deep pit of despair, as I did.  One of the worst parts for me was that I saw how it affected those around me.  I was staying with my Mom for a while during this time, and she would cry (in private but I knew that she was crying because of me.    It hurt her to her core that I was going through this.

Although she is still at home and no longer inpatient, her progress has stalled, largely due to a lack of medication compliance. After experiencing psychotic depression that made her spend 5 weeks in the hospital, she was released on her own accord and went home. We were all optimistic, as she had made considerable progress in the hospital. Unfortunately, once she was home, she decided that she was fine and didn't need to follow the doctor's instructions. She stopped going to therapy and taking medications. Her recovery has reached a plateau and we are all nervous waiting for the next ""break."" The last one was due to intense stress, so we are all walking on eggshells trying to keep stress out of her life. This is difficult because my sibling and I live in a different city than her and my father is in denial that this is a severe situation. I visited home over the holidays and it was hard to see how she is not taking care of herself. My father just pretends that everything is ok. My sibling is helpful in these times but feels at a loss, like myself. We are hopeful that at point she will take her meds again but are not optimistic. Not a day passes that I don't worry. I have found that I have to create distance for myself so I don't worry too much. Due to this I am in regular therapy.

Still, I was able to imagine what it would be like if I was in the narrator's shoes.","Three months ago, I woke up to find my mom lying in her bed. She wouldn't get up. Her skin was blue and cold. I have never felt anything like the horror that came over me when I realized she was dead--to be honest, I kind of blacked out mentally and don't remember exactly what occurred, but I don't think I'll ever forget how hopeless and terrified I felt in that moment. I looked over to her nightstand and saw a note, she couldn't deal with the pain, the loneliness, it had all become too much for her, but really the details don't matter, do they? The end result is the same, my mom is gone, she took her own life. I felt abandoned, I felt alone, I felt guilty--was I not enough? Was there something I missed? Could anything have gone differently if I had done this or that? We can't change the past, but we sure can feel anxiety about it. I couldn't undo what she had done, but I felt like she needed to matter in some way, that I needed to show her an interest and love that maybe if I had shown her in life this terrible thing would have never happened. I decided to use this as an opportunity to learn more about her life, which of course tied in with my life, my history, my heritage. We had never been too close to most of our family, we lived across the country from the majority of them, I didn't have any way to contact a lot of these people, who were total strangers to me. I ordered a DNA kit online and was able to get the names of some of them. We ended up connecting online, and I learned I had aunts, cousins, even a grandfather--I was still lost in a dark tunnel, but now I felt like I wasn't so alone. I ended up connecting with one of my cousins via social media and I'm going to be flying across the country to go see them in just a few months. I was able to hear stories about my mother's childhood and it was like finding a whole new facet of her that I never would have learned in life.

We had never been very close to begin with.  We also hadn't talked since mid-2011, either.  My mother had always told me that my father was from Ireland, but he had died by suicide when I was very young, and I never knew him. As a response to the grief I felt over my mom, I did a DNA test, and started to discover my Irish heritage and making contact with 400+ relatives in and around Ireland and the EU. Due to the fact that he was from there, I had automatic citizenship, but needed an Irish passport to ""prove"" it and obtain full dual citizenship. I spent a few months gathering all of my documentation. This included my dad's birth records from 1933 in Ireland, his military records from his service in the Korean war after moving to America years later.  I have never felt more connected to someone I never knew. I have never felt more complete and confident of who I am and where I am going.  Planning to visit and ideally move to Ireland has been the greatest gift, and one that I never expected as a result of such a massive loss of my mother to suicide. I literally cried for a week after I found out, and was convinced that I would never feel happy or whole again. Luckily, the universe had different plans for me than I had for myself.  The universe understands we are placed here to be happy and healthy and to thrive.

Joining me on this trip was my best friend, Dale. We met up in the morning, packed up everything we needed, and set off on our adventure that would surely change our lives. Dale and I were headed to Yellowstone national park, a place we had always wanted to visit. The drive there was long and tedious, but eventually we arrived. We parked, checked in, and got all our stuff ready to set out. We started our journey through one of the many beautiful forests this park has to offer. There were towering trees, lush foilage, and everything was teeming with wildlife; it truly was a site to remember. In awe throughout this forest trail trek, I truly felt at peace and calmed by the beautiful nature, and Dale expressed the same feelings. Eventually we started coming across rolling hills as we got deeper into the forest. A noise started ringing throughout the forest, which sounded as if something was letting out a call. As we got closer, we realized it was some kids and a family having fun up on a hill further on the path. We shouted back to the kids, just playing with them; but their group saw us and told us to come join them along the trail. As we talked for a little, Dale and I discovered this group was headed to the sampe campsite as ours, so our journey continued with new friends. We shared stories about our life, dreams, and our love of nature. Bonding with these new people felt nice, especially in such a magical place. As the end of the day approached, we finally arrived at our campsite and set up or camp, as did our new friends.

I first went to it alone. Then I went to it with my husband. Then I took my girlfriend to see it last night. The movie was about an event that was a fantasy and yet totally believable. The characters were sweet and lovely and they made you want to know what happened to them and you really cared about what happened. The music in the movie was so phenomenal and kept you on the edge of your seat. I also had acquired the tickets for a really good price. That made it more justifiable to see it so many times. I intend to buy the movie when it becomes available. I may see it again soon with my son who wants to see it too and has not done so yet. The movie just makes me happy when I see it because of the joyfulness. The way they overcome their challenges with love and understanding is so lovely. It makes you want to persevere in the things you love as well. The actors that portrayed the characters in the movie were remarkable. They were so realistic that you totally believed what was happening to them. They also were humorous and had many friends. Movies that include friendship and love are so rare nowadays and that was refreshing. The fact that they were not white Americans was surprising but surprisingly a very good choice. It was sweet but not syrupy sweet. It was a fantasy and yet a believable story. The story was just a remarkable way of showing perseverance and love with ordinary people. I hope that the movie academy of arts and sciences will consider it for some award. It was a brilliant concept and a wonderful story to impart to all ages. I've been telling everyone I know about the movie now.,1,I went to see this movie as I was out shopping because I remembered seeing what it was about and thought it sounded wonderful because it related to the Beatles.

In order to save money, I have them sent from my insurance by mail order. I had just run out of the medication for my fibromyalgia when I checked my mail and found something from the pharmacy. But there was only one medication, the one for heartburn. I thought the other two may have been sent separately. I was worried because you're not suppose to stop taking this medication and even missing a single dose can make you a little sick. The first day I started getting increased pain, especially in my knees. I also started having problems thinking and concentrating. By Sunday I started feeling very weak, dizzy and like I had a bad stomach virus. I ended up really sick. I couldn't eat much and that also made my blood sugar issues worse. The pain got so intense that it felt as though all my bones were being twisted. It was like being in a nightmare. They had agreed to reconsider the medication and said it would take about 10 days. But as things kept getting worse so quickly, I wasn't sure I'd last that long. I live alone, so I kept my door unlocked in case I needed emergency help and couldn't open it myself, or to make it easier to find my body if I died. I didn't bathe for a few days because I worried I'd be too weak to climb out of the bathtub and possibly slip and die slowly from a head injury. They finally agreed to cover the medication and sent it express. I am still recovering from this. The worst of the pain is gone, but the knees still hurt. Since I also struggled with depression all my life and this medication also helps there, I've been really struggling with more depression. I'm still having trouble thinking and concentrating and my greatest worry is that my brain might not come all the way back. I'm suppose to see my doctor today to check on the progress.

I had helped him through avery difficult period in his life when he experienced the loss of twoclose family members. I was glad to be there for him, but personalitydifferences created tensions that eventually came to a head aroundlate 2017, when we had a bit of a fight and stopped speaking to oneanother. I was regretful of some of the things I'd said during thefight and tried to make amends, but he was not interested. At the time he texted me, I had pretty much just written off thefriendship and assumed we would never speak again. I had thought ofnot replying, due to the bad experience of the past interactions. However, I was concerned that something may have gone wrong for him tocontact me, of all people, and replied. He had contacted me to inviteme to his wedding, which would happen in a few weeks. I was verysurprised, and told him I would definitely consider going, though itwas short notice. I couldn't decide whether to go to the wedding or not for the next fewweeks. I didn't know if it would be a good idea based on how badlythings had gone in the past. I eventually decided to go, just out ofcuriosity to see what happened. I'm glad I went. The wedding was avery nice ceremony, and I got to meet some very nice people there. Ihad a brief chat with my estranged friend, and things seemed to begoing much better for him. I was happy for him, and got to meet hiswife, who was very nice. The food and reception were very nice, and Ileft feeling like we were on good terms again.

He and I had not spoken in almost two years because we had a falling out towards the end of 2017. This was a friend I made in graduate school, and with whom I used to hang out fairly regularly for about four years. We would go to the movies, go hiking, have lunch, and other things. I helped him through a particularly rough patch when he lost two people close to him and went though a breakup within a year's span. I was glad to have him as a friend and we could talk about important matters with one another. At one point, however, our friendship became very strained, and we had an argument, after which we didn't speak for almost two years. When I received that text (which was simply a ""Hi, how are you?""), I was very unsure about whether to respond to it or not. I put it off for a few hours, but finally decided to answer back. I did not receive a response for several days, and was not sure what happened: whether he was experiencing a major issue or just wanted to be friends again. When he finally texted me back several days later, it turned out he was reaching out to invite me to his wedding. He was getting married the next month, and wanted to reconnect and make amends. I was taken aback because I had not expected to ever hear from him again. I was cautious about going, but decided to accept his invitation after consulting with a few people about whether it would be a good idea. The wedding was in just a few weeks, so it was short notice, and this would be the first time we were seeing each other in almost two years. I was afraid it would be awkward or tense. Luckily, the wedding was a beautiful occasion, and I was glad I went and was able to reconnect with him after all this time. His wife is a very intelligent and lovely woman, and I am happy for him, especially after the difficult time he went through.",1,"My friend V., whom I had not talked to in almost two years, texted me out of the blue.

I can deal with that. He emails an invoice on the last day of every month, which is due within 20 days. I always just pay right away, so there's never been a complaint from his end.

I mean, I've always paid like the day I get the bill. He definitely didn't have me confused. He just kept being rude until I finally sent him back a message telling him basically where he could shove his business and what I thought of him. It really stressed me out.

I never thought the day would come where I would become a mother.  At the age of thirty five and after years of trying to get pregnant and having two miscarriages, I had given up on having a child.  My husband and I were looking into adopting but the process seemed pretty hard and there were no guarantees.  In the end, I got pregnant out of no where and I was shocked to my core when I found out that I was pregnant and I was two months along.  The fetus appeared healthy and I was on my way of becoming a mother.  Three months ago, my daughter was born; a healthy 7 pound 3 oz.  No one or nothing could have prepared me for the profound love I have for my daughter and I feel so lucky to have the opportunity to be a mother to my sweet girl.  I love her so much and my husband and I are so very happy.  We can't wait to see what the future holds and we are secretly hoping to be blessed with another child.  The changes in our lives have been mostly positive and some negatives.  The positives are having our child and being able to make life long memories with her.  Our families have been great through out my pregnancy and they have been so helpful in the last couple of months.  On the other hand, the negatives are not getting enough sleep.  I feel tired and excited most of the time, and there are times when I doze off every chance I get.  The worry for our child is horrible at times and its a major drawback for us because in the back of our mind we feel like this beautiful experience might not last and can be easily taken away from us.",1,"After a long wait and many failures, I am finally a happy mother to a baby girl.

My mom told me that bath time was always my favorite time because I would swim around in the bathtub and that's why she decided to put me into swimming. I was 8 years old when I had my first swim meet and I can remember it clear as day even though it happened over a decade ago. I remember diving into the pool and swimming as fast as I could and even taking peeks at the lanes on either side of me to see how I was doing overall. When I touched the wall at the end I thought I had lost and the first thing I told my mother when I got out of the pool was that I sucked. My coach reassured me that I was better than I thought and shortly thereafter I was bumped up into the bigger pool where all the 'big kids' practiced. I would go on to swim for this team for 10 years during the summer. When I started my freshman year of high school I tried out for my high school swim team and made it and then around the same time I joined a club team so I was swimming pretty much the entire year with not many breaks in between. When I was a senior in high school I was given the opportunity to go to schools on a scholarship for swimming but I decided to go to a school that I really wanted to go to even though they hadn't offered me a scholarship, but I was allowed to try out as a walk-on. When I started my freshman year of college, however, I changed my mind. I just felt like I couldn't do another four years and I really needed a break and I didn't want my college experience to be consumed by swimming so decided not to try out for the team. It was a really hard decision and I felt guilty. It was eating away at my subconscious and I would always have nightmares and I felt like I was punishing myself. It took a long time but I finally got the courage to get back in the water. Swimming is pretty much all I've really known so when I got back in the water it just felt right and I've been doing it ever since.",1,"A, now adult, decides to rediscover their love for a sport that once consumed their life during their teenage years.

It had been about five years since I had last been a pool. Since I was about 8 years old I had been swimming competitively over the summer at my neighborhood pool, from there I swam for my high school team, and then around the same time I began swimming for a club team. Between morning practices before school and then practices after school as well as the occasional swim meets that took place throughout the week my schedule was booked. I would go to my club practices every Saturday meaning essentially I got one day off every week which was Sunday. When the season was up for high school swimming I would go on to continue swimming for my club and then during the summer I would do both club and swim for my neighborhood swim team. Swimming was my life. It was all I had known since I was 8 years old and when I was 18 I had to make the painful choice about whether or not I wanted to continue swimming in college. I ended up choosing having a social life over swimming to a lot of people's dismay. Towards the end of my high school career I was emotionally and physically drained and I felt like I just needed a break. So I went on to have a normal college life with no swimming involved. It was difficult. The guilt definitely took a toll on my subconscious. I would have dreams all the time about getting back into the pool and I wondered if I had made a mistake. I began to avoid pools at all costs and it wasn't until recently that I decided I was ready to get back into the water. A light that seemed to have dimmed inside of me was now brighter than ever and it just felt right and I've been doing it ever since.",4,"A, now adult, decides to rediscover their love for a sport that once consumed their life during their teenage years.

Until, that is, four weeks ago, when a most peculiar accident set into motion a series of events that has forever altered my life. I was turning left onto Broadway from Franklin Ave, when this total dill-weed on an electric scooter appeared outta nowhere and ran into my side-view mirror. I rolled down the window and hollered, ""Watch where you're going, you total dill-weed! The street is for cars!"" but she didn't seem to hear me. However, as I was angrily watching her e-scoot away, I rear-ended the car in front of me. The woman who was driving flung open her door and approached my car. I cut an intimidating figure, however, and when I exited my vehicle she quickly choked on her words at the sight of my 5' 4"", 255 pound shadow bearing down on her. ""Lady,"" I said, ""Where'd you learn how to drive? Dukes of Hazzard reruns?"" That's when I realized she didn't understand a word I was saying. My daughter, who happened to be with me at the time, recognized her peculiar language, so I instructed her to give this woman a serious dressing down. ""No, dad,"" she said, ""this accident was clearly your fault. And besides, I think I recognize that bumper sticker."" The woman had a very large Smurfs bumper sticker, which was now crumpled from the impact of the accident. My daughter asked her some questions and determined the woman to be the mother of her childhood friend, Tabby. They hadn't seen each other in some twenty odd years. The woman was on her way to visit Tabby in a mental institute, and my daughter asked if she could tag along. I objected at first, because I don't want my daughter hanging around crazy drivers with Smurfs bumper stickers, but my daughter winked at me and whispered, ""I'll make sure the insurance company doesn't get involved, here. I promise, dad."" What a strange coincidence. And what a great daughter.",1,"I had a very serendipitous car accident.

Fortunately, it wasn't a hard hit because because we were only driving about 15-20 miles per hour. There was a woman with 2 small children in the car that hit my car.  We both pulled over to the side and eventually moved into a parking lot. The woman who hit my car did not speak English and I was having a hard time understanding her. I speak spanish but it's a bit rusty. I had my daughter help translate because she speaks spanish fluently. The woman gave my daughter her ID and some paperwork from the car. I wanted my daughter to let the woman know that since there wasn't really any damage to my car, I wouldn't call the police or file a claim. When my daughter was talking to the woman their conversation became animated. I was picking up on the conversation in bits and pieces but couldn't really understand why they were so excited. They continued speaking for a while and my daughter pulled out her phone and started searching for something on her phone. She showed the woman an image of my daughter with another young girl from about 15 years ago. Then the excitement really grew. The woman wrote down a phone number and gave it to my daughter. Finally, my daughter and the woman hugged and my daughter and I went back to my car. It turns out that the woman that hit my car is the mother of one of my daughter's school friends from a long time ago and the two young children in the can were my daughter's classmates children.

I wasn't expecting much, honestly, because we are not rich by any means and usually birthdays are a pretty simple affair. After a delicious home-cooked dinner, my husband and I were just about to dig into some cake when he slipped away to our bedroom to receive a wrapped gift. I was already so surprised, since we don't typically do gifts. He looked so excited giving it to me, I couldn't help but tear into it. Inside I found concert tickets! This was really thrilling because we haven't been out to see anything live in years and I've been dreaming of doing something just like this. What really got me, though, was when I noticed that the tickets were to go see Paul McCartney! The Beatles (and Paul) have honestly always been my favorite since I was a child, but I never imagined I'd go and see one of them live. I was so touched, and my husband just had the cutest smile on his face. I didn't want to say anything, but I know that the tickets must have been pretty expensive and it would have taken him a long time to save up for them. I just think it's one of the sweetest things he has ever done for me. The next night we went out for dinner before catching the show and the whole thing was just a dream. We had so much fun and I felt ten years younger! We danced and sang along together, and when we went home we both couldn't stop talking about how great the show had been. I don't think I will ever forget this birthday, it was such a delight.",1,"I wrote about the Paul McCartney concert that my husband gifted me for my birthday. My love of the Beatles and Paul.

I have always been a Beatles fan and Paul is my absolute favorite. My husband is not a rock music fan so this gesture was truly meaningful me as I knew he would go to the concert, but it may not be his favorite way to spend an evening. We also lost part of our income last year so this was truly a splurge for us. When the evening finally came we found babysitters for our kids and made the trip across town for dinner and then to the show. It was our first time visiting this particular venue so it was definitely an adventure getting there and figuring out parking. We had gotten there early so we had a chance to just sit and relax before the concert started. And then there was about a 30 minute delay to the actual concert. Once the concert started though I knew that everything we had gone through to get there had been worth it. I'm not too proud to say that I teared up when Paul took the stage. He sang a lot of my favorites and the stage was lit up with images of him with the Beatles, Wings, and his later solo career. There was even a huge fireworks display that shook the entire stadium. I clapped, yelled, and sang along and my husband also seemed to have a great time. This might have been the best birthday present ever.

One of the cats was being very squirmy and energetic while his cage was being cleaned, so I walked over and offered to hold it while she straightened everything out.  He almost immediately settled down and started purring in my arms, rubbing his head against my chin, and closing his eyes.    I struck up a conversation with the woman about the cat because he had a very distinct personality.  We talked a bit about his adoption history and how he'd been returned several times by past adopters.  But after hearing and reading about his ""behavioral issues,"" I couldn't gel them with the experience I was having with the cat I was holding.  I spent almost an hour asking questions about the cat, working up to the idea that I'd be taking him home with me.  The whole time he was just purring in my arms and didn't want to go back in his cat condo or even get back down.  We made some calls to the rescue head and I arranged to borrow a carrier for him and pay his adoption fee by check later.  I took him home that night.  It was touch and go for awhile, because he'd moved around so much and it took a few weeks to get him fully integrated with my other cats, but he eventually bonded with a younger female I took in last year.  She spent a few weeks under the couch when he first came home, so it's amazing that they're such good friends now.  They spend their days cuddling on the couch and have taken to taking care of a younger kitten I adopted since.  He's a very affectionate cat that is very emotionally perceptive, and he'll always jump in your lap if he senses you've been having a bad day.  He's a member of this family now and he's been renamed Kismet because everything around the situation just seemed like it was fated.",2,"I saw a cat being a little energetic while his cage was being cleaned at the pet store.

I held the cat while she was cleaning the cage and he started purring, rubbing his head on my chin, and practically went to sleep in my arms.  I got to talking about the cat with the woman, learning a bit of his tumultuous history.  There was no way this cat would have all the behavioral problems that the sheet said he did.  I scritched and chatted for almost an hour and, by the end, I had all but adopted the cat.  I took him home with me that day, borrowing a carrier from the rescue group to transport him.  Although the first few weeks were rough, he integrated well with my other cats.  The other young cat hid from him for quite some time, spending almost entire days under the couch and staring at me with eyes that said ""Who this guy in my space?""  Eventually she snuck out to sniff him before darting away and, one day, I woke up to find them both on the bed.  Opposite corners, to be sure, but together on the bed!  It was a great relief to see everyone be happy.  I named him Kismet for the twist of fate that brought him to me.  He's been an amazing cat and even a surrogate dad for some kittens I agreed to foster.  He's very fond of kittens, letting them crawl all over him and cleaning their ears at every opportunity.

So I went in my brother's car and drove through a small route I normally go for discretion. On the way I put small amount of cannabis in my pipe and smoked a little while driving. At that point I decided I should drive around and listen to music, then I should go to the bank. I took a long route around, and noticed at some point a cop car ended up behind me. I was nervous, thinking they might have known what I did. While I was nearing the bank, the cop car was still behind me, and eventually started flashing its lights. I thought I was surely done for, and as the two cops walked up after I had parked in a Barnes & Noble parking lot I thought I might have a panic attack. To my surprise, I was acting calm enough as they stated the reason they pulled me over is because the car was unregistered for a couple months. I didn't have up-to-date documentation and had to call my dad to get me a picture of proof of insurance, but it was surely better than them noticing any wrongdoing. Throughout the ordeal they didn't suspect anything, as I had hidden away anything suspicious and there was no smell. I was very lucky that day, especially considering I had illegal narcotics within reach in the car. I believe this will be the last time I do something so suspect on the road.

It was a cold night and there was not anyone around. My best chances of surviving were to reach my home. I was down on the pavement and hidden from view by a car. I was not able to get up. I could not move or make any noise. I felt blood oozing from the back of my head, where it hit the paver block. i felt blood on both sides, presumable from when I had hit myself twice during my fall. With every passing minute, my survival was becoming questionable. I was worried that I will pass out and bleed to death.  I was thinking who will be coming around the street, at this hour? There was another thought in my mind, if anyone in my family would miss me at home? Will someone from my family will come looking for me? My kids will be be hooked on to the wifi and glued to their smart screens, ipad or laptop or mobiles. My wife will be busy doing the dishes and getting things ready for a swift morning departure to school and office. She may realize I was missing after another 60 or 90 or minutes. This made me to wonder, will I be around after 60 or 90 minutes? I couldn't remember anything after this.

My friend pulled the car over to assist me in waking up  and start CPR on myself until the ambulance arrived. I took the ambulance about 15 minutes to get there, and to administer the Naloxone. At this point I was unconscious with no pulse until the Naloxone was administered. Once inside of the ambulance I died once more with no pulse until the EMT attendants started CPR and resuscitated me. I ended up going to the nearest hospital which was about 25 minutes away. I was kept in isolation for about six hours while the nurses and doctors ran test on me. I ended up having side effects from the situation. I was diagnosed with pneumonia, collapsed lungs, and bruised lungs. I was released from the hospital that night, but had to return for a two day stay at the commonwealth hospital.

Just this week out of nowhere I got a ton of new follows and went from being a small nobody stream to a not too small not quite a nobody stream with a couple hundred follows and an eighty viewer average. It was at this moment that I realized that maybe I actually could make streaming into something. Apparently people like to watch me once they discover me and find my brand of humor amusing. My wife is currently my only moderator but this also means she's watching my streams when I'm playing and we've grown closer because of the sheer amount of stupid twitch chat/streaming involves. Last weekend I got a dono from someone that touched me. In it they talked about how they'd been going through a rough time of their lives because their parents had gotten in a car wreck while they were on vacation. They had both lived but their father had gotten paralyzed. He'd been depressed since the accident since he'd always been an active man but now couldn't do that anymore. His father asked him what he was watching and he showed him the stream and they wound up watching me for the entire three hours I was streaming that night. His father's mood apparently improved and he even asked when the next time I'd be streaming is and asked his son if they could watch me together again. I'd never thought that doing something as silly as playing video-games and just shooting the shit with random people in my chat could help. I'm glad to find out I was mistaken though and even if it's just a guy and his father I'm happy to say it at least helped two people. My wife however is living the ""I told you so"" dream at this point and keeps rubbing in that I should have started sooner. Now if only my father was still around so I could join the ""I told you so"" bandwagon since he always said ""You can't make money playing video-games"".",1,"Started streaming at my wifes behest, discovered that I actually enjoy it.

A little adventure as observed.   The train was seven hours late in eastern Manitoba;  Suddently we stopped in the middle of the dark forest. One of the drivers came to the last car, the bar car, where we were. He said, ""we missed a flag stop, there is a trapper and his dog out there. We cannot leave him in this cold (-33 C)."" If you want to know about cold read Jack London, ""To build a fire"" book. We could see a very faint light about 2km behind the train. Then  we backed up until we came to where we saw the trapper, his baggage and his dog. A couple of attendants jumped off the train tended to his baggage. The train, 13 cars and about 500m long, continued to back up. The trapper's big black dog was taken into the heated luggage car, the first car after two locomotives, wrapped in blankets and placed near and electric heater. Our resident chef was arousen and went to the kitchen at a very late hour to prepare a warming meal for the cold man.

We all grew up together, and the said cousin grew up with us in the same house, so I regard her as more of a blood sister than a cousin. Immediately after I received the call, I called into work to tell inform that I would not be coming in that day for family emergency reasons. Shortly after, I drove to the hospital were she was admitted. When I arrived at the hospital, my sister was already there along side with most of the patients family members. We were all worried sick for her because there were no apparent symptoms, and according to her husband she slept very well the previous night. After a while, the test results were in and it was determined that she had brain cancer. We were all scared for her, but it was also our duty to remain strong for her. Over the next couple of weeks and months, we tried to encourage her to fight and remain strong. She first started with chemotherapy, which was not doing her much good. She then opted to have a surgery. The surgery ended up been more complicated than we expected, but after all the surgeries, she continued chemo. At this point we thought she was in a good place, and that she was recovering. A few weeks later she died. It came as a surprise to all her well wishers because we genuinely thought she was getting better. Two days before her death, she went out with her husband and kids, and they had some fun.

In this particular case, my sister in law had two daughters and a husband who were also affected by the diagnosis. The girls had a very close relationship with their mother. One daughter was planning a wedding at the time and her mother was very involved in helping with the planning. This was a very difficult time for all involved. The illness  put a damper on the wedding planning and placed a dark very cloud over the joyous occasion. My niece had a difficult time keeping things in perspective during this time and even thought of postponing the event. My sister-in-law was determined, however, to keep the focus on the wedding planning and go forward with my niece's wedding. In the end it was probably the best therapy for all to go forward with the plans. Her other daughter suffered from ADHD and had been under the care of her mother all of her life. Although she was almost an adult now, the news of her mother's illness was very devastating to her. She relied on her mother heavily in her day to day life. The thought of losing her mother was overwhelming. My sister-in-law's husband was also quite dependent upon her as he also had a seizure disorder. He could not drive and needed her assistance throughout the day to manage.

I woke up on a bright sunny day feeling like the world was mine for the taking. I had an important meeting for work later on that afternoon, but did not have any other obligations until then. My parents had recently just divorced and my father had moved into his own little apartment in town. He was never the best at making meals for himself so I had started the habit of dropping him off some casseroles that I had prepared for him. I feared that he was lonely and heartbroken after my mother's infidelity. So, on that beautiful summer morning I decided that I would use my extra spare time to lend him a visit, and bring him some delicious lasagna that I had baked the night before. I drove there with the roof of my convertible down and the wind in my hair blasting some old favorite rock songs from days past. When I arrived to his residence, I saw that the cat was out on the porch. This struck me as unusual as my father had always been adamant that we watch the doors and not let our feline friends risk being run over by traffic. I picked fluffy up in my my arms and proceeded through the half opened door. I called out for my father with no response. I noticed a note on the counter that was addressed to me, it read: ""Honey, I love you, please do not go in the bedroom"". My heart started pounding out of my chest as I ran over to the bedroom. To my horror, I found my father laying on the floor, his head covered in blood with a revolver by his side. He had taken his own life and left me to find him. He had left me behind to face his horrific death. He felt as though life was no loner worth is for him, that I was no longer worth living for. I wish I could have known, I wish I could have saved him.",4,The event that I can most vividly recall that happened in the last 6 months was the passing of my father.

My dad had been complaining about feeling different and he had symptoms of the flu. He thought that if he just stayed home from work and rested up a bit he would be up and feeling better in no time. He was starting to feel better the Monday before everything went down, but he was not completely himself at that moment either. I went to work that day just like I normally do, but around two in the afternoon I got a call from my mom saying that she was taking my dad to the hospital because he was unable to remember things that were happening and things that he always remembered. I told her that since the school day was almost over I would finish out the day and then I would head to the hospital afterwards if they were still there. I finished the day out at work and immediately left school to head to the hospital because my mom said that we all needed to be there as soon as possible to talk about some things. When I got to the hospital I was taken up to the ICU, which was strange to me for someone that seemed to only be suffering from the flu. When I walked into my dad's room I was terrified. He had never looked as weak and out of it as he had that day. He didn't even know who I was. My mom had been crying I could tell, but  she didn't want to talk in front of my dad, so we all went in the hallway. When we got out of the room my mom completely fell apart and told us that my dad was suffering kidney failure. I was astounded because he never showed any signs of this before and was never told anything about this at doctor appointments. He was given 3 weeks to live. I was so scared and sad and I didn't know how to react, but only to believe that this couldn't be true. The next day my family and I spent the entire day hanging out with my dad in the hospital, although he was totally out of it by this point. I remember that day before we headed home for the night telling my dad that I would see him tomorrow and that I loved him very much. That would be the last time I ever saw my dad. He passed away in his sleep at the age of 56. I am still devastated to this day that this happened and I will forever question why this happened to him.",3,The event that I can most vividly recall that happened in the last 6 months was the passing of my father.

My life will be forever changed. My dad had been sick with what everyone thought was the flu. He was throwing up and complaining of being very tired and hot. He didn't even have a fever. He had been sick for a few days, but on a Tuesday in the early evening everything quickly spiraled out of control. My mom called my husband and asked him to hurry over to the house because she thought something was wrong with my dad. He went over there and my dad was not doing well at all. He didn't know his name, where he was at and who my mom or my husband were. My mom immediately called 9-1-1. When the ambulance got there they immediately checked my dads vitals and got him loaded to rush to the hospital. They took him to the intensive care unit and got him hooked up to a million different machines to see if they could figure out what was going on with him. By this time it was late into the night on Tuesday. We were all sitting in the waiting room until more information was known. It was a very long night of millions of tests and no answers. Finally early in the morning on Wednesday a doctor came out and told my mom that my dad was suffering of kidney failure. We were all in shock because he hadn't been sick long at all. We asked what we could do and the doctor said it was too late too do anything and that if they even tried to operate he would die. The doctor could not give us a timeline of how long he would live, but that it wouldn't be more than six weeks. Well, it turns out it would be even sooner than that. By early the next morning my dad had passed away. We were all in shock because there hadn't been any warning signs and just a week ago he had been happy and hanging out with us. We were devastated and from that moment on our lives had changed forever.",3,The event that I can most vividly recall that happened in the last 6 months was the passing of my father.

We were always going to have a party with friends coming over before we left, so this just seemed like the best time to do it. I also got to use the smoker on my bar bq pit that I really never got to use, so that was a plus. It was just nice to be able to grill or smoke again, besides making my wife and our friends and family happy, it also gave me inspiration to do more cooking and grilling from now on. I think something else that really made me feel good was people asked for the recipe. But I had to give the person on youtube credit which I did every time someone asked me. My wife was really surprised that I was cooking for her, which made me nervous before it was done. But as soon as I knew she liked it when she tried, I was relived. Her opinion was really the only one that mattered to me in the end. It does help that everyone who tried said they liked it.

My wife had planned a vacation that included her and the kids but not me. I unfortunately was unable to go. I had brought up cooking some bbq to send with them on this trip. She was all for it. I generally cook several times throughout the year on our big offset cooker. When I do this we generally have friends and family over to enjoy some bbq and have drinks. Occasionally I will also share with the neighbors and make kind of a big thing out of it. I woke up around 4am the day before she was leaving and got the cooker going. This was easy as I made sure everything was in order and prepared as far as the cooker goes the day before this, all I had to do was start the fire and go in and prep meat. I went inside and prepped about 30lbs of meat to cook. She had some last minute running around to throughout the day, and I stayed back in order to cook.  During this particular cook, these hit their plateau and stayed there. Probably longest plateau I have ever experienced since I have been cooking bbq this way. We pulled them from the cooker at around 10pm-ish and let them rest. When they were ready we shredded/pulled the meat and vacuum sealed all of it for the trip. We had talked back and forth for the first couple days and she never mentioned eating the bbq. I just thought maybe they heated it up and a few people joined them for dinner and really didn't think much of it. I had received some pictures in a text of a big tent set up and tables and stuff. I wasn't sure what to think. I wasn't sure that everyone would like my bbq. I received more pics of everyone eating bbq and having a great time. It was a success. Some people she explained had three and 4 pulled pork sandwiches.

Throughout the year I will have a few big cookouts, have people over to eat and have drinks and will generally share with neighbors as well.

I threw the meat on and tended to the fire all day all while she ran around took care of any last minute errands she needed to take care of before leaving. The meat hit its plateau, one of the longest I had experienced in my roughly 20 years of cooking bbq. Stressed because even when these were finished we still had work to do. At around 10pm they finished, we pulled them and let them rest. We then quickly shredded, and vacuum sealed all the meat for her trip. She leaves on her trip. We talk occasionally but no mention of the bbq. Day 2 passes, still haven't heard anything about the barbecue I sent. I just assumed it would be a few people and a maybe a small dinner get together and they would probably enjoy it. On day three I received some pictures of some tables and a tent setup with my bbq on display. They had invited everybody. At this point I am concerned. Is this type of bbq everyone's cup of tea? Apparently so, as I received a picture of groups of people eating and having a good time. My wife called and said it was a huge success, some even had as many three to four pulled pork sandwiches, she explained that people who didn't even plan on coming showed up to eat after they heard about the bbq.

She had lost her balance and hit her head on the table and caused her to have a concussion. My heart sunk to the floor.  The emotions that flooded me are hard to describe. I did not want to see my grandmother in that state. They doctors decided to do an M.R.I. and found out that the tumor spread down her central nervous system (CNS). After this concussion, this had kept her in the hospital for a few days, she was advised to have all around healthcare. I decided to be all around health care for my grandmother. I bathed her, fed her, helped her use the bathroom. I was basically watching her dying. Her cancer spread more, and she would have grand mal seizures at night. She was scared when it happened. I had to hold her and use calming techniques to assure her I was there. I asked myself why did I sign up for this? Because, I cared and loved my grandmother very much.

She should focus on long-term goals to feel better. The laptop is really nice though. And if I hadn't recently built myself a PC I would have considered getting one as well. The touchscreen function on it would be great for my digital art. It also has a decent graphics card so would be able to handle some of the games I enjoy playing.

I almost gave up on the possibility of adopting a new cat. When one Saturday early afternoon, I walk downstairs to the parking lot, and my 3-year-old sees a stray cat. The cat was sunbathing on the side of the walkway. We walked over to the cat to greet and pet, and the cat ended up being so friendly. Since I was unsure if the cat belongs to someone, I left the cat alone but came back to check on it. The cat followed us home and stayed outside the whole day in front of our door. Several of days later, the cat was still hanging out in front of our doorsteps and that’s when I realized that we had been adopted by the stray cat. The cat had joined out family and is living with us now. The cat is an outdoor cat, but he stays close to home. He will come to eat and sleep.

We started seeing each other, but as time went on, it became evident that distance and lack of time were going to be issues in pursuing anything further. I brought it up to him a few times and he brushed it away, saying we'd figure it out eventually. He did come to see the same issues I did and confess that he didn't see any way of making any more time for the relationship in the foreseeable future. On my end, my own financial issues and obligations kept me from being able to close the gap on my end either.  It was heartbreaking for me, because I have been single following a divorce for several years and hadn't had much luck meeting anyone, and I really liked him. We decided to stay friends even though he seemed fairly insensitive to my experience. As we continued spending time together as friends, we decided to try to make a relationship work again, coming from a place of increased understanding and better communication. Since the event, things have been going much better between the two of us, so ultimately, what was very sad at the time, turned into something positive. Confronting the issue of not having enough time, he has tried to be in contact more frequently and to make an effort to spend more time together. In service of that, he has introduced me to his daughter, so we can all spend time together. I have also made an effort to go to his place more frequently. I've met his parents as well.

We hit it off well and got close quickly, but it soon became very clear that he doesn't have any time for me in his life. I talked to him about how I was feeling and he tried to understand and do what he could, but ultimately there was just no way forward. After not barely hearing from him for a couple days, I messaged him to tell him that I wanted to make it work and I tried, but it was clear that it wasn't possible and I couldn't be his girlfriend. He agreed that there was nothing he could do to change his situation and how it related to me and our potential together and that it made sense to end it. Although I wasn't expecting anything different, it hurt a lot that I could see he hadn't actually put any effort in, other than deciding to tell me he loves me, and that he so easily let go of the possibility of having any future. He was the one who insisted we try to be together, despite the obvious challenges. I feel even more like he doesn't care about my feelings or find them valid, because I told him I was concerned we weren't on the same page since the very beginning, and he insisted we were. I cried in the bathroom at work until I could finally pull myself back together. Meanwhile, he decided that the idea that we would be friends instead should start right away and sent me several messages complaining about his job. I had to tell him that I'm sorry he's frustrated at work and I care for him, it seemed really tone deaf at the moment and that I needed a beat before I could swoop into the role of providing him with emotional labor while getting nothing in return. I mean. I didn't say it in those words, but that's how I felt and it's just a new level of pain, because did he actually ever care, or did he just like someone caring about him? I feel like this is just another example of the fact that I will never meet anyone and I will spend the rest of my life alone.

Most of his meals have come from a plastic package or a drive-thru, with a giant soda to wash it down. I tried not to judge him for it, but over the years I noticed he had started to gain more and more weight. He just didn't seem to care. I mean, I love to indulge at times, but it got to the point where, if we got pizza, he would have three or four slices for every slice I had, to the point where we had to get him his own extra large pizza every time. Well maybe I was too gentle, but I was never able to talk sense into him. Until one day he was feeling so dizzy at work that he fell over and had to leave early. It turns out, he went to the doctor and had to get some tests ordered, and he has diabetes. Type 2 diabetes. His doctor told him that the only thing he can do about it is change his diet completely. He has to avoid carbs now; if he doesn't, he will have some serious health problems. Now maybe this is a weird way of looking at it, but I see it as a wake-up call for both of us. I wasn't able to help him before, and now he's sick. But it's not too late for us to do something together. We've been learning to cook healthy meals together, which has been a lot of fun for both of us. It's something we never knew we might like to do together.

My partner has always been a picky eater and only seemed to like to eat what I consider crap. After the diagnosis, it was devastating to him, but made me feel like we might be able to get on the same page with our diets. Or, at the very least, it would help prolong his life.    Unknown to me, the day my partner was diagnosed, he made peace with the idea that he would no longer be able to eat like a teenager. He swore off sugar and carbs and began looking for alternatives. I, on the other hand, was dreading telling him about all the things he could no longer eat and thought we would be arguing about meal time from now to eternity. For all the years we have been together, he had never expressed anything except disgust at any meal that was not deep fired or coated in sugar. I was prepared to go to battle.   When it came to buying groceries, I had a battle plan in mind. I was going to ease him into the sugar alternatives and try and introduce vegetables and meatless meals slowly so as to not upset him.  He surprised me by being the one to go straight to the Splenda and the produce aisles at the grocery store. I began seeing things like berries and whole wheat oatmeal in our cabinets. I noticed the lack of cookies, candy and frozen snacks in the house. It happened so quickly that it took me by surprise. I found myself proud of his food choices and wondering how he had the willpower to break the life long habits of the past.    About two months after the diagnosis, we had a talk. I asked him how he was able to make these drastic changes in such a short amount of time, and did he think he could keep it up. He explained to me that after the diagnosis, he became scared. He read that you could loose your eyesight to Type 2 diabetes and he didn't want that to happen.  He also explained that he had finally taken to heart that his diet upset me and he wanted to live longer for me and our relationship. I was so touched, and proud of him for being able to do something that I thought he would never be able to do.    Today, our lives are quite different than before. We eat sensible meals, we incorporate meatless alternatives into our diets and we haven't purchased sugar in over three months.

As I mentioned in previous entries, my sister moved out of the country to take a position for a new company. This was a big deal for her, as it was something that she wanted to do, and was excited about. A little over a year ago, she started to feel ill, so she want to the doctor. After doing some medical examinations, it came back that she was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. The doctor recommended exploratory surgery. About 4 months ago, they proceeded with the exploratory surgery, and discovered that is was less serious than they originally believed (which is a relief). The bad news is that they cannot safely remove the entire tumor. I spoke with my sister on the phone just now, and she is in good spirits. I have always known her to be optomistic about life in general, and I know that she can pull through. Even still it is scary to think about her mortality, and also the fact that I may not see her again. She did invite me to come out for a visit in the summer, and I am excited to make that trip as I have never left the United States before. Now I need to focus on saving up money for the flight, and also thinking about what I would bring with me! Hopefully the weather would be good when I go.

I mean, I never met a medical waiting room I liked, but at least in a doctor's office or the emergency room, there are other people, things happening, a sense of progress. Surgical waiting rooms are separate, special, and if you're in one in the middle of the night it's just your group, alone, waiting for news. It makes funerals feel good. With my sister's brain cancer in some ways, it's a little bit like we never got to leave that room. The outcome of her surgery wasn't bad. It turned out that her cancer was much less aggressive and serious than they originally believed. It wasn't good either, though. The tumor was in a dangerous spot, and they couldn't safely remove it. So we're back to normal now, and for the most part, everything is great, but in some sense, we're still just waiting. This has all been much worse for Sarah, of course, so I completely understand that she's been determined not to let this whole thing dictate how she lives. More than that, maybe. I'm not sure she isn't to some degree making decisions just to prove that she isn't letting herself be limited. That's a little scary, the idea that just maybe her choices are based more on pushing her boundaries rather than doing what's really best for her. She's excited about her new job, though, and I'm certainly not going to try to tell her she shouldn't take it. There are great doctors in Amsterdam, too, and she seems confident that she's got the insurance all figured out.

Amsterdam has excellent health care options, but her doctors here are very good and know her case. She says it's not a big deal and that she'll still be doing a lot of her tests when she flies back here, but still. The insurance situation is complicated, too. She says her company deals with this sort of thing all the time, and that they know what to do, but there's a difference between someone who's insurance is just in case and her situation. She can't afford any lapses or mistakes, and I'm not convinced everything will work out as smoothly as she thinks. Still, she's incredibly excited, and this does seem like a great opportunity for her. It's not my place to tell her what she can and can't do, so all I can do is be supportive and try to make sure she's doing everything she can to stay healthy. Not that she needs much help, she's been incredibly motivated not to let this thing stop her. That's probably part of why she's so all-in about this job. At least, for the first time in her life, she's moving and I don't have to help. Her company is taking care of everything, and except for one chair that I grudgingly agreed to store for her I don't have to lift a finger. She may or may not get the chair back.

However, when I turned 18 and moved out of state for college , our interaction became very minimal. It was time before internet, cellphones etc. Even local interstate calls were expensive. I used to visit every holiday and spend as much time doing common things, but, as time went on the intensity of activities started to slow down. Time went on , I graduated after four years and graduated college. I took a job in the same state where i finished college and settled permanently. He moved away for his job in California and our meeting and reunions became even less. Nowadays, we meet up about once a year at our parent house. Nowadays, when we meet we still reminisce on those old times and talk about our youth. It sure was the best time of my youth.",4,"My siblings grew up and decided to move out of state to go to college.

My family moving away, in this event something I knew was going to happen eventually happened, I'm not a very social person and some of my only friends are my siblings, and on this day they moved away. This was a normal day like any other and I had both of my siblings moving away for college, we had a rather normal day watching tv, namely avatar the last airbender, we watched it like we always do on sunday evenings and it was honestly kind of depressing knowing it was the last time for years we would do it. The day was fast, we all talked and laughed and we cleaned up my sisters room together to get everything we wanted out of it before she left, I remember watching her walk up her stairs and go out the door, and get into her car and leave, it was a little heartbreaking. My brother just left, we had both cleaned his room too and he was ready to go, he had been getting in fights and arguing with my mom a lot, they were both ready for him to go. They had both prepared for college and were going to be leaving soon around 6pm, they were getting ready to go on with their lives, and to live their futures without me. I felt happy for them, I know they were both going to do great things, one was going to art school in new Jersey and the other was going to study Dance in Chicago, both prestigious places. I did feel great sadness though, they were two of my closest friends, two people who really understood me, and they were both leaving, and I had few other people to talk to. I tried to get them involved in everything before they went, I tried mini-golfing,movie watching, mystery shopping and just plane video games and board games, and we did have a blast, but it was depressing knowing they were still going to leave the very next week. I even got them involved in money making schemes like apps and survey programs, but they weren't interested, my best friends they may have been but they still didn't share all my interest. I also tried to get them involved in Overwatch and Minecraft and other online games so we could have things to do and they agreed to play but they unfortunately faded out of them, and they left our group. They still continued to chat every once and while and we watch shows streamed but they get farther and farther away chatting with their own groups and making new friends, I try but its hard to get them interested and they're growing more and more distant, and it hurts. I've purchased tickets to allow my brother to travel to come see me in Lincoln for thanksgiving and I'm excited, he's said he's ready to come back for a bit and come see the family. I'm excited and I'm ready to try to bond with him again and I'm excited to see how he is. My sister is coming back too, so I can't wait to see how she is and see if the events of the day she left have any effects on how our personality's have developed.",5,"My siblings grew up and decided to move out of state to go to college.

It's the last necessity for the month and as expected, I had just enough so I left the house with nothing but my card and a few dollars in change. My card was declined twice. I asked the cashier to hang onto my stuff for a few minutes so I could step outside and call my bank to sort it out. It turns out that only moments before, my bank withdrew my monthly fees. They were a week early so I wasn't impressed but I still had enough if I used the change I had. It was a pain in the ass but not a financial crisis so I headed back in and stood in line again.

I was appalled that this was allowed. I chose to go back to school as I felt my future (despite glowing reviews and taking the lead during FDA audits) was limited. I applied to my alma mater's MBA program and was accepted one week later. I was happy and proud of myself to finally doing what I have been talking about doing for years. When school started, I was incredibly busy and was assigned even more work at work. I attempted to negotiate a raise, but was told that despite doing the work of 4 people ( I was the lead of 3 other people, who were reassigned to other teams when those teams workload exploded), my work was not ""risky"" therefore I should not be paid more than other people on the overall team. That made no sense as I had 10 years of seniority over all but one other person, had a proven track record, and was highly sought out by other teams as a SME during audits. I was also in a MBA program, thus bringing more value to the company. School is my saving grace. School is what will get me out of this toxic company and I am glad I finally decided to apply to grad school.",1,I was bored of my job and tired of it. I decided to apply to grad school.

It makes me so happy to see him grow up and reach these points. He is looking more like a grown-up every day as he begins to develop. I think he is ahead of the average child and so these things are very important in assessing his development and advancement because we want him to be at the top of his class.  These things are so important to me because family is so important to me and he is the most important part of my family. I have joys and sorrows vicariously through him and devote my life to making his better. I really want the best for him and life these things make me so happy because they show me that I’m succeeding in some importance. I think other people should find the same joy.

I broke up with my first girlfriend of almost four years. It was a traumatic experience, one that I keep thinking back to and realizing that I have grown a lot since then but that also things will never be the same again. I often catch myself thinking where things went wrong, specifically, why I did what I did. While we were long distance for a few months, I went to see an escort. When we met up again, I was quite distraught and eventually couldn't shoulder what I did. I went online to find what others have done in a similar situation and one night, I was driven to confess thinking it would rid my guilty conscience and that if we were to have a successful relationship, it had to start over somehow. I told her what I did and I only remember how disappointed she was. She only cried a little bit and before the week was over, we had broken up. She realized I was made immature decisions and hoped that maybe if we met again in New York, we could get back together again. On hindsight, maybe she was letting me down easy. For the first month after the break up, I was extremely stressed. I would go to sleep at around 4AM and wake up at around 1PM. I felt like I lost a part of me. We had spent a lot of time together over the four years, almost every living minute. But we both realized we couldn't be together given what had happened. So I spent a lot of time trying to bury what happened. I was completely unsure of why I did what I did and the most shocking thing was that how unexpected everything was. Yet, everything came crashing down in the span of a week. I lost a lot of hair in the following few months after this, a condition called telogen effluvium, diagnosed by doctors. Still now, I feel like I don't understand my actions and by extension, myself.",3,The story is about a reflection about a breakup experience.

Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw. The city was gorgeous and full of history. There were small bustling streets, people enjoying a drink on terraces, olive trees fields everywhere. Through my friend, I was also able to take a tour of the city and discover it was full of history and had a critical role in shaping the culture of Spain. I really had no expectations and was really surprised. Not only were the people friendly, but the food was also amazing and the setting beautiful as well.

This was about 4 months ago, and was in the south of Spain, a part of Spain I had never been to before. Before the trip, I was extremely busy and had very limited time to actually plan the trip. Therefore, I had fairly low expectations about it and didn't think too much about it until it actually happened. I had been fairly often to Spain before (mostly the North), and therefore thought that the South was very similar to it culturally. However, once I arrived to Ubeda, the little village where my friend's wedding was taking place, I realized I had been all wrong. The streets were narrow, the town was full of culture and beautiful monuments due to the its rich history and culture, and I couldn't believe my eyes. The trip made a strong impression on me and made me fall in love with the town. People were friendly, the food was delicious. Over there, people have jamon, with bread, tomatoes, and olive oil at breakfast. Initially, it seemed strange to me but by the third day, it seemed so natural to me and I feel like I had lived there my whole life. My best friend's family was warm and lovely as well. I realized quickly that it was a defining personality trait of people from the south of Spain. Toward the end of my week-long trip, I began dreading my departure from the city, and tried to take as many mental pictures of the trip as I could so I would never forget it. Specifically, the wedding cathedral, the endless olive oil fields, the jamon available at every restaurant in town, the beautiful weather and the friendliness of the people. Since I have been back, I have already begun planning my trip back, as well as learning Spanish, and this trip had a strong unexpected impact on my life.",4,"I went to Ubeda in the south of Spain for my best friend's wedding.

I had no choice but to live out of my car with my family for about two months.  Being homeless and living out of a car is not something I would want anybody to go through. It hard and embarassing and crushing to your self-esteem. I felt like I had no control over my life and that I did not do enough to keep a roof over my head. And the cats hated being stuck in a car, can you imagine that added stress. Finally my fiancee's parents said we could stay with them until we got back on our feet again. Although I was grateful for this it was uncomfortable living with people who have such hateful opinions of gays/lesbians. I dont have these feelings so I did my best to ignore that because like I said I was grateful for a place to stay. We are slowly getting back on our feet and I hope that it continues.

My fiancee and I have been living together for three years roughly. We were never well off, but our bills always got paid and we usually had plenty of groceries. Our two cats never had to go without and some might say they were spoiled. It knocked my self confidence and my belief in myself down to nothing. I second guessed every decision we made that could have possibly prevented us getting evicted. I think about it constantly because I'm still recovering and dealing with the aftermath. I often get depressed that I don't feel self sufficient and I have constant flashbacks to living in my PT Cruiser with my fiancee and my two cats over the summer. I felt like such a failure and hated seeing the woman I love be so hopeless and sad. I still have days where the feeling of failure overwhelms me. I've basically had to go back to square one. All the progress I made and was making in my adult life got set back to zero. All of the plans and goals we had set had to be pushed into the back of my mind. I couldn't focus on saving up money for my wedding, my health, a second car, etc. Those goals are now wishful thinking. I have to muster up the energy to just get out of bed and will myself to accomplish anything. I have to get a new job again, look for a smaller cheaper apartment again, struggle, and worry that I may not be able to afford the necessities. I might not be able to pay for any medical emergencies, or taking one of my cats to the vet, or a surprise car repair. It's humbling on the bright side, but wears you down as a person on the realistic side.

I find it beneficial and therapeutic to write out these experiences. I believe that writing everything out is the only real way that I can begin to heal from these events. It was only a short time ago that I got evicted from my apartment. There were several reasons why I got evicted. The first and most direct reason I would say is that my roommate, Cole, moved out unexpectedly. He truly just got bored with living there and made way too much money illegally and not nearly enough money legally. It definitely took a toll on the household. He wasn't pulling his weight and he truly hated that I wanted him to get a real job. So he moved out and that was that. Unfortunately, he left less than a week before rent was due and so I was stuck paying for all the rent plus my other bills. I tried making a payment plan with the front office that ended up not working. When I was served with an eviction notice, I really went into denial and thought I could save the apartment rather than take immediate action and go out looking for a new place to live. So when it came time for court, I was told I had a week to vacate. I couldn't afford or find a new place in time and I was moving my things out of the apartment at the very last second. The problem was that I felt responsible for my safety, my fiance's safety, and the safety of my two cats. Yet I had nowhere to go. We had to take all of our belongings to a storage unit and stay in our car. We drove a PT Cruiser at the time and luckily it was pretty roomy after taking out the back seats and building a little bed area in the back seat. We made a litter box for the cats that we could put a lid on when not in use. It was hard because I felt like such a failure that couldn't even take care of my family. This went on for well over a month of having to find places to park at night and sleep, find food, brushing my teeth and washing my hair in public bathrooms, and hoping that I can find places to shower or do my laundry. The stress got to me and I wasn't sure I could even keep going. Now I'm living with my in laws and slowly trying to rebuild my life. The only real downside is their aversion to the fact that I'm a woman dating their daughter.",5,"I was evicted unexpectedly from my apartment leaving me, my future wife, and my two cats had to live in our car for two months.

The weird thing about it is that we both attended the same school. When I went to the graduation ceremony it was a trip and a half. It reminded me so much of all the good times that I had as a young teen and how much different the times were back then. I was a youing adult when I had her but it seems like a lifetime ago. Times were so much easier then though. The internet hadnt been invented yet and there werent as many bad temptations as there were when I was growing up. Now with he world wide web it seems as if there is way to much information at our fingertips and it has made the youth a whole lot lazier. Anyways, as I was walking through the halls I remembered places that we would get together and talk between classes and doors that we would run out of if we decided to play hookie or sluff. I remembeed all the little girls that I wanted or did kiss. ai remembered where my old locker was and it turns out that it was in tha same hall as mine. I wonder if I would have been friends with my daughter if things were different and she wasnt my daughter but just another peer. I talked to her about all of the things that were going through my head and she said that I was weirding her out. Then I asked her about what high school she wanted to go to because she had the choice of three different schools in the area. She said that she wasnt sure cause she wanrwed to go to a school that the majority of her friends went to but she also wanted to not be distracted because of them as well. I on the other hand made the decision ro go to a school that none of my friends went to so that I could focus on studies and it wasnt a very god choice for me. I ended up having as really haed time because I didnt know any one and in turn it affected my studies in a negative way becaus I never wanted to go to class I wanted to go and hang ouy with my friends. I just hope that she makes the best decision for herself and it works out well for her in the long run, School is supposed to be a fun time when wr get to learn about ourselves and others and how to succeed in a modern day environment. O have faith that she will do well. I have discdussed this with her and told her that what ever decision she made that I would have her back no matter what. I think that if I dont put as much pressure on her about it that she will make a better decision and iy will enrich her future. All in all it was a trip to walk down those halls with a different perspective than what I had before.

This is defined as Atrial fibrillation (also called AFib or AF) is a quivering or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) that can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications. I also had liver problems. This diagnosis scared me very much and so I immediate began reading all the information I could and watching videos about the subject and immediately began making the necessary changes to my diet and lifestyle in attempt to reverse these symptoms I started exercising on a regular basis and improved my diet and when I went back the doctor the tests showed improvement in a short time and I was told to keep working at these changes and being consistent and so I did. I continued eating healthy and exercising on a regular basic and returned to the doctor every few weeks to check my progress and each and every time they said I am improving and to keep up the good work. I went home feeling hopeful. I then continued reading as much as I could and changed my diet to a much healthier almost 100% plant based with a few eggs from dads on occasion and Ive ordered some foods that I am unable to get at my local grocery store. I think the variety of foods is helping me and certainly the exercise I am getting is helping me feel more refreshed and I feel that I am in better physical shape than before I was diagnosed. This has changed my life and given me new hope. I have learned to eat different foods that I had not eaten before. This has changed my life and I feel younger than before. I have been discussing these changes with my doctor and with family and now several members of my family are asking me for recipes. We also plan on working together to grow more food this year as this will give us exercise and supply us with fresh foods. I have also located a CSA that I plan on joining as they deliver fresh food weekly from their farm in a large box. I also have been visiting the farmers market and have worked out a deal with a local grower to help them on their farm during the growing season in exchange for food and money.",1,"I went into the hospital in April because i was not feeling well.

I had been really bummed since my dog of 15 years past away due to old age. I had been very depressed about my dog's passing and I thought it may be a good idea to adopt a new puppy. My family, especially my youngest son has been wanting another dog. Although it would be tough for me to take on the ""emotional"" responsibility of  having another pet, I feel that my son deserves to have a loyal pet, the same chance I had. Plus having a new puppy around is always super interesting, challenging, and FUN. This will allow me the chance to delegate and teach responsibility to my son. He is 11 now and I feel its time for him to take up some chores. This will also allow him to grow closer to the dog.. as I did with my previous pet. Seeing the new puppy brought joy to my family and my son was ecstatic. Truth be told I really got a little sad and I thought about Nova, my previous dog. Nova was great dog and we were really close. The new Puppy will soon take over as the family pet, but I will never forget Nova. She definitely made my life more interesting and enjoyable. I am very much looking forward to this new challenge and I believe that the spirit of my old friend will be part of this new dog.",2,"I adopted a new puppy.

The style and overall design really attracted me the the Audi line. With a strong financial income and little to no debt I thought that it was time for me to make my dream purchase. I went to my local Audi dealership two weeks before vacation with high hopes of driving away in my dream car. Two dealerships later and a whole lot of negotiating I was given the deal that worked for me and was able to drive away in my brand new Audi A3. 	It was a cold April night when I finally completed signing my life away and was handed over the keys to my new car. I will never forget the smell of that black and grey leather interior. Also, the feeling of the heated leather seats! Due to the weather that night and how late it was I decided to head home and wait until the next day to go for a nice long ride. I left my house the following day after admiring the exterior of the car and how good it looked parked in front of my house and headed straight for the beach. I know, surprising right? Heading to the beach on a cold April day? Yes! To this day I enjoy my rides to work just a little bit more each day thanks to my beautiful Audi A3.

Not too long ago the prices have gone down and it's more affordable, so I've been able to purchase one. I was very excited to show it off to my friends and family. I held a party and let people try it out. Since then multiple people have talked to me about it asking questions. Such as how can they get one, what kind of PC do they need, etc. It's been a blast to be honest. Showing it off to my parents and other family and friends has been incredible.

I had no trouble, until a group of volunteers coming from the opposite direction with their dogs attempted passed us. All the dogs started to bark and pull at their leashes. A few started to fight, and it caused some of the volunteers to panic. Eventually, we all gained control and finished the walk without further problems. I returned Betty to her pen after the walk, then went to ask what else I could do. I was given the task of washing up the linens, beddings and toys in the laundry room.

It has begun the previous day and the uncomfortable feeling just didn't go away.  At 3:30 AM, I drove from the San Gabriel Valley to the facility, about 15 miles away.  My friends still think I was nuts and my family agreed, saying that this apple did not fall far from its tree, seeing that my dad did the same thing when he had his heart attack at 65.  While at the emergency ward, I began to get suspicious and came up with this conclusion:  the more different doctors visit you in a two hour period, the more serious the condition.  For the next few hours, I was prodded, tested and sent to another hospital where two stents were inserted to make the ""widow maker"" work better (it was 90% blocked).  Within a few days, I was released. However, the world I knew for 61 years changed with those three days.  Probably the greatest challenge wasn't so much the junk food that consumed this average baby boomer so much as the time I had to take to make that work.  Seasoning food without salt takes creativity. Substituting fruits and whole wheat involves careful planning at a store.  If i eat out, I have to check the menu more carefully to eliminate anything with too much sodium, or with processed sugar.  In short, this new diet demands attentitveness, something I ignored when it came to health, but didn't when it came to work.  I'm not through though.  In a few weeks, I have to meet with a cardiac surgeon.  Yeah, bypass.  That means a few months recovery at a time where I don't think I have the strength or resources to fully get back on my feet.

My doctor initially told me it would be a good idea to help ease my symptoms, but I'm starting to really enjoy being out and about. About three months ago I was especially restless one morning and opted to take myself out for a day of fun. I hit the local mall and walked all through my favorite stores. I probably spent a full hour in Macy's alone. I bought a pair of new sandals and a really cute beach hat too, which are things that coincidentally help reinforce this new lifestyle I'm trying out. After shopping I stopped into a new restaurant that opened near the mall. It felt odd to eat by myself, but after a few minutes I really started to enjoy it. I almost felt like some important business person. My steak was perfectly cooked and I even had a margarita to drink. By this point I really started to feel my legs getting achy, and the 100 degree temperatures outside didn't exactly help things too much. Against my better judgement I ended up deciding to see a movie to cool down, but found myself frustrated when I realized the theater's air conditioning was turned off. Who turns off AC in 100 degree heat?!? I ended up finishing the movie, but my legs were not in great shape and I was feeling quite dehydrated. After sitting on a bench for a bit to gather my thoughts, I determined that I should not try to get home in this shape. Thankfully my good friend Judith answered her phone and was willing to come get me and take me home. I apologized to her for overextending myself on this day, but I think she understood how much I enjoyed my independence.

I knew this was necessary to completely reset my immune system and also to improve my mindset and bring me back down to earth. My drinking and eating habits had been spinning out of control and experience has taught me that this was the best solution. I succeed for 11 days! Very proud of myself, I tried to ease my way back into some semblance of a life. One morning I woke up so restless and energetic that I decided it was time to revisit one of my favorite haunts: a place called Town Square. There I knew that I could get a quality lunch with good company and a nice glass of rose wine. I also needed to do some shopping and figured I could grab a snack and catch a movie; something I hadn't done in a long time. The problem arose, however, as soon as I arrived. Suffering already from fatigued having had to wait in the increasing heat for a bus, shopping was a bit difficult. I found respite in the changing rooms. I was able to purchase the items I wanted, however, and proceeded to the bar to dine! Two lovely fish tacos, the special of the day which included the glass of wine all for only $12. I was very proud of myself. But here I hesitated. I knew that eating would make me tired and thought maybe I should just Uber it home and catch a movie online somewhere. But no, stubborn me persisted in going to the movie theater. The heat was vicious by this early afternoon hour. I barely was able to drag myself to the theater and certainly some people thought I was drunk! How embarrassing! I finally had to call a friend to come pick me up. Four hours later I made it home.

The doctors were worried that I could get an infection so they decided it was best not to wait for her to come on his own. I was really nervous about this, it's absolutely not what I had in my birth plan. Then again, when does life ever go as planned? I hate to admit, but I did ask for pain medication and honestly I am so glad I did. She really didn't want to come out so they had to use a vacuum assist for her to finally be born.

I arrived at the hospital early, around 6am. I got checked in and got my bed. Around 8am I was visited by my OB and given pitocin to start labor. I couldn't feel it for a while. Around noon, my OB came back in and we discussed how things were progressing. It was going pretty slowly so we thought it would be a good idea to break my water. I decided to get my epidural first, since I wanted a relatively pain free birth. After the epidural was placed, I felt pretty sick. I had to be given some medicine to help raise my blood pressure and to help reduce the nausea. After a while I started to feel better. My water was broken and labor started to progress, though things were still slow. I spend most of the afternoon dozing off in between commercial breaks. I managed to watch some of The Force Awakens and one of the Avengers movies. Around 8pm I was ready to start pushing. I was worried about this part because it was where I had trouble with my first child. I was already tired from laboring all day and from not having any food to eat. I pushed for a couple hours and was so close but was having the same problem that I had the first time. Baby's heart rate was starting to drop with each push so about 20 minutes before 11pm my doctor decided to use the vacuum to extract my daughter. With one push, she was out. The delivery went better than my first. I was able to hold my daughter right after the delivery. She was much bigger than the scanning ultrasound said she would be.

Still my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to try it. It tasted awful, like seriously, the worst thing I have ever purposely drank. At first I really didn't see anything happening, other than excessive use of the bathroom. But after two or three days and around ten pound of bad stuff being removed from my body I began to believe it was actually working. It worked really well for like two weeks, and then it wasn't really doing anything anymore. This kind of disappointed me but I was determined to keep going, and keep getting my body healthier. So a month ago I started a different way, I started getting more sun, and eating more raw foods. I went on walks, and just tried to let my body detoxify as naturally as possible.  It helped a lot, After a week or so of that I began to lose weight and could feel myself becoming stronger. It has been a wild ride.

Our bodies are wonderfully designed with complex pathways designed to eliminate toxins. As apart of my self-learning, I began to research the supplement, alpha-lipoic acid. Convinced that this supplement could be beneficial, I began taking this common supplement. If one believes the hype, one could expect miraculous improvements in one's health if detoxification is impaired.  Upon taking the supplement, I noticed unexpected physical responses that were not in line with improvement in health. This caused me to dig deeper into this supplement. In the process, I came across the knowledgeable scientist from Quicksilver Scientific, Dr. Christopher Shade. It was during one of his presentations that I learned how the body can have blocks in detoxification as a result of exposure to toxic mold. This surprising fact caused a light bulb to go off in my mind. I had personal experience with toxic mold exposure, and this fact led me to believe that my unexpectedly lackluster response to alpha-lipoic acid may be due to a mold-induced block in my own detoxification system. Thankfully, there are good strategies for dealing with this sort of block in detoxification, and products designed carefully and comprehensively to assist in maximizing activation and functioning on the detoxification system. I encourage any reader to explore the Quicksilver Scientific range of detox products, and especially the Push Catch System, as well as to take advantage of the available teaching resources and seminars presentations available online from Dr. Christopher Shade.",2,"This story highlights my personal journey in discovery of the body''s innate detoxification processes, and how to overcome blocks to detoxification.",150.0,0.018914898857474327,,0.019545828979551934,0.014223510972582377,0.02446657602334968,0.01857514261232259,,0.0006309301220776067,-0.00469138788489195,0.005551677165875353,-0.0003397562451517358,261,13,5.46360153256705,0.6206896551724138,33,20.076923076923077,0,15,13,0,0

I started taking i because I learned that this naturally occuring compound is purported to be a highly beneficial compound with trong anti-oxidant and detoxification-supporting properties. The supplement is also used to support liver function and help alleviate neuropathy.  Upon taking recommended a dosage, I developed back pain. As a scientist, I began scouring medical literature as well as watching biomedical presentations. I began a intellectual journey in learning about the body's mechanisms for detoxification. One of the most important scientists to help educate me in this area was Dr. Christopher Shade, CEO of Quicksilver Scientific (a company that specializes in biological testing of toxins and supply of carefully formulated nutriceuticals designed to help promote detoxification.  Through Dr. Shade, I bean to understand the body;s complex and intricately choreographed mechanisms for identifying, tagging, mobilizing, and eliminating toxins from the body. In addition, I learned about environmental factors that could lead to a block in detoxification. In my case, my medical history and symptomology supported a block in detoxification created by a significant exposure to toxic mold. As it turns out, mold biotoxins can block the body's ability to clear a number of toxins, including heavy metals, and that without removal of this block, use of other methods that stimulate portions of the detox process (such as alpha lipoic acid), may be hindered.  This can put undue stress on the liver and kidneys.  Fortunately, Dr. Shade also was instrumental in recommending a simple dietary remedy to this mold toxin-induced block to detoxification. After a very short amount of time, my troubles were greatly diminished. I am grateful to Dr. Shade for his knowledge  and insight, which has enabled me to proceed in a lifestyle of detoxification as well as identify mold biotoxin as a source of many of my chronic health issues.",2,"This story highlights my personal journey in discovery of the body''s innate detoxification processes, and how to overcome blocks to detoxification.",4444444.0,0.019922929557247296,,0.02240467577378998,0.02090173372067107,0.027306314611551998,0.030780693825767633,,0.002481746216542683,0.0009788041634237743,0.007383385054304702,0.010857764268520337,313,18,5.421725239616613,0.6134185303514377,46,17.38888888888889,0,16,13,0,0

It was an office manager job at the sewer plant in the small town my parents live in.  I knew the people who worked there and the person doing the hiring.  I called him immediately and he wanted to me to send him my information.  He said he thought I would be perfect for the job.  I met with him the next week and was offered the job.  I was so happy.  The job is only part-time, but that works great for me.  I am able to work in the mornings and go to doctor or physical therapy appointments in the afternoons. I am so excited to start this job.  I will be the office manager.  I know I will have a lot to learn, but I am so looking forward to it.  I hope this is the start for a better future for me.  I will be doing the work I like and I will be able to do it without putting more strain on my body.",1,I got a new job at the sewer plant after being laid off for 6 months.

I love this new job more than I ever thought possible. 6 months ago I really thought my life was over when I quit my job with no plan for the future. I admit now I quit on an impulse, but it felt right. I had been getting harassed at work by this horrible employee named Jan. She was inappropriate and rude to everyone, and no one stood up to her. I was trying to complete a project at the office while everyone else was enjoying the Christmas party. Jan kept coming into my office to ask me to drink with her and to dance, it was obnoxious. She was obviously drunk,. I asked her several times to leave me alone and she would not stop touching me and harassing me. After an hour of the constant annoyance I snapped. I told her exactly what I thought of her and how terrible she was. Everyone just stood and watched. No one joined in or had my back. I was distraught. My supervisors watched me be harassed and did nothing. After my outburst I knew I was done at that company, so I quit. I just grabbed my things and walked out. I remember getting in my car and crying my eyes out. I needed that job. I hadn't done anything wrong.

She usually always harassed the other people in the kitchen but today she decided to harass me more than anyone else. I think why she disliked me the most was because I made it clear her behavior was unacceptable to me, while everyone else would just smile at her and than say terrible things about her when she left. She decided to try to bark orders at me, despite me being equal to her at work. She got so angry at me she would blow up at me before taking her break, and than while on her break she called the other co-workers in the kitchen to tell them to make sure I wasn't messing everything up for everyone else. She would threaten me, and berate me the entire day which my boss was entirely aware of. When I brought it up to my boss, just like I had done so dozens of times in the past, he just brushed it off and said to ignore her. I finally decided I had, had enough of my job and handed my boss my two weeks notice before leaving the building. He tried to guilt-trip me into staying by suggesting that a person with tough skin could handle it, and everywhere I go people like her would be there. However, I made it clear to him that in other work environments bosses enforce rules and if they're not followed the person is fired. My boss finally got the big picture of the problem with my co-worker and pulled her in to have a talk about her behavior, she came out quiet but proceed to be just as bad the next day. When you have a job where no one is ever fired, they never feel the need to change their behavior. When my two week notice was almost up, people kept telling me they would miss me and I was a good worker. That made me very happy, and made me feel like I had made a difference to people at my job. I think about that place sometimes but never do I miss it. While I hated to work there, I must admit it taught me a valuable lesson in dealing with others. My co-worker who harassed me left a week after I did, with my work asking me if I would come back shortly after. I of course, said no.",2,During a Christmas Party a well-known bad employee harassed me as I tried to work.

She started openly complaining about only she was smart, only she did any real work, etc. Everyone had told me since I started here how terrible she was and how badly they wanted her to be fired. Despite this, no one would ever do anything about her or talk about her until she left the room. Finally I snapped and decided not to sit down and take it like everyone else. While she started insisting she told me to do something I was never told, I told her to her face she never said that. She lost it and started to scream at me, while she did that my boss just ignored it like he usually did. I decided I had enough of a boss that wouldn't do anything and handed him my resignation, which was more than he deserved. He tried to convince me it was cowardly to leave, but I told him it was cowardly to not fire her. She kept harassing me through the night until that point, then my boss decided to take her to the back room and yell at her for having a coworker finally quit over her. She came back out and stayed quiet for the whole rest of the night. I left that job and felt good about leaving, they all already didn't like her but it was made worst once she actually cost them a good employee who at least tried their best which was more than half of the people they hired did.",3,During a Christmas Party a well-known bad employee harassed me as I tried to work.

We weren't ready for the long grudge matches. We had expected to run through the competition. That isn't what happened though. Our very first match we overlooked the team we were set to face.

I have known many parts of the world, many people, cultures and have heard their stories, legends and the wisdom they have. But two years ago I decided to take a trip but not one to another place but I gave myself the task of knowing the people around me thoroughly, to give them my confidence, to know that world they have inside their mind. Because as I say each person is a world, some are full of goodness, wisdom and much love but others are rotten by deception and evil. A few weeks ago on my trip to meet people I came across an old woman who gave me the first impression of being a kind, honest and honest person. I managed to talk to her, meet her and it was so good that I had fallen that I started a few days to give her an extremely good confidence. I could tell her everything and she, until one day I made a request, and this was to lend him $ 2,500 to pay his mortgage, when he told me this I was a little surprised by his request and after thinking a little I decided to give him the money. After a few days of lending him the money, that nice old lady who had met and liked me so much, began to change his way of being with me. It became more closed, when I visited her home she didn't attend me or sometimes she didn't even open the door to greet me, at that moment I started to see that something was very wrong. Although as a kind old lady I thought, ""Surely she must be busy or sick and doesn't want to help me.""But one day I met her at the walmart and she saw me when she was surprised and greeted me with a lot of hypocrisy and left, it was no place to talk about the loan. So days and days went by until I took on the task of inquiring if she really had used that for her mortgage, the truth was that no, I spend it on something I still don't know. Seeing this, I went to her house and argued with her I was so upset that I could not even think, I felt so deceived, and I told her that I was going to report her to pay me the money. It was a very tense moment. Until she confezo me it was my grandmother, that grandmother who had believed missing since long ago, that grandmother since childhood so much wanted to have and now hate her for having deceived, that grandmother tricky and very unethical. In the end, I decided to forgive her, she wanted to maintain the relationship after the lack of respect she made, I just decided to get away from her and continue with my life.",2,"I was fooled by a nice old lady whom I thought was honest.

I had to take it in stride and try to make it through each day. Survive each day really. A month ago she tried to corner me publicly and fully go back on our agreement that brought me down here. She told me she wasn't going to give me any more money in public hoping to pressure me to agree or look like the bad guy. She was the one who ended up looking like a fool. Previously I had told her that she didn't have to give me any money on two occassions, and in front of everyone I made this known. I also told her that I didn't want her money and that I resented being treated like someone trying to take advantage. This lady is a bad person whoever and none of this phased her.

You hear of some fantastic revelation some day up on the mountain, or a close encounter with nature, even a brush with some insane disaster, bringing the person onto the doorstep of death. Most people quote extraordinary event that is very unique to them and hear about how that something have come to have a great impact on their lives, changing the very manner in which they view life and perceive it. You might not find my story to be anything spectacular, but for me, it has been the one most singularly amazing event of my life. It was the day that I met my husband. He came into my life and affected me in so many ways and for which I really do not have words to describe. Yet, I will try my best to portray how his coming into my life completely changed me and gave me a whole new world to look at. One of the things that I noticed immediately when I met my husband was how safe and secure he made me feel. I remember meeting him that very first day and realizing how good I felt just being with him. It was as if a burden had been lifted from my shoulders. I suddenly felt free and relaxed, as if I had to worry about nothing in life ever again. He would be very supportive of my ideas and my decisions and would encourage me to go ahead and do what I wanted the most. He provided me with the background support that I had always needed to further to my plans but had felt so insecure before. He had a knack of making me laugh and feel good about myself and whatever was going on at that time. Aside from making me feel emotionally stable, safe, and secure, he also made me feel very secure financially. He made it look so easy, as if I would never have to worry about money ever again. He made me feel that I could trust him with no matter what. This is perhaps the reason that I married him in the first place, because of how he good he made me feel about myself: very safe, secure, and sound.",2,"I am a much happier, wiser, safer, and more confident person after meeting him.

It was me, my mother, brother, and my husband. We usually go to Florida every summer. It's just something that we do as a family. Ended up needing to go back home after 3 days into our week long vacation because my friend's husband got sick. She needed someone to stay with the kids and I am the closest to her in terms of friendship so she called to see if I could. I told her that I was in Florida for the next week, but if I could come I would. She broke down and cried and I ended up feeling bad and seeing if everyone was okay with me going home and everyone else staying. Well, no one wanted to stay so we all went and saw if we could get some plane tickets. When I saw the cost of them, I freaked out! Why were tickets so expensive? I can understand it being over priced due to short noticed, but the prices were unreal! I tried to talk my family into staying since we all had tickets for later to go home with, but they insisted on coming and just rescheduling the vacation. I ended up having to whip out my credit card and purchasing tickets for all of us. The price was something that I was not happy about at all! I can't imagine that price and all the way home on the plane I just thought about how much I had to charge on the car for these tickets.",1,"My flight home from vacation got canceled.

Mom, Dad, my twin sister Hope, and I boarded the plane in NYC and flew down to Phoenix, where we switched to a flight to San Pedro Sula. We landed in the heat and humidity of Central America, and got a shuttle to our hotel on the beach. Our rooms were beautiful, on the eight floor, and we quickly unpacked, showered, and changed. It was now early afternoon, so we decided to grab a late lunch and decide what to do with the rest of the day. There was a cool-looking bar and restaurant right on the beach, so we walked down there and got a table. It was the tail-end of lunchtime, so the place wasn't too busy and we didn't have to wait for our table. Our waiter was pleasant and knowledgeable, and we ordered a couple different seafood dishes. I recall that I ordered fish tacos, Hope ordered a shrimp cocktail, and Mom and Dad ordered something different from either of us so we could share. A short while after getting our food (which was delicious), the bartender came over with four drinks. He told us they had been ordered by someone who had then left in a hurry and he was going to throw them out unless we wanted them. They were typical ""resort"" looking drinks, with umbrellas and fruit, and we gladly accepted them. About ten minutes after this, I began feeling a little queasy. I looked over at Hope, and she looked unhappy as well. I didn't say a word, just nodded, and looked at our parents. They didn't seem to be having a problem, but as I watched, my father suddenly coughed and turned red. ""I think we should get to our rooms right now,"" I said to him, and he nodded and took his wallet out. Mom was doing the best of us at the moment, but we were all rapidly feeling worse. She grabbed the waiter and gave him plenty of cash, and we all made our way to the hotel lobby. Waiting for the elevator seemed to take an eternity, but we finally got to the eighth floor and into our rooms, where we spent the rest of the night in our own miseries, throwing up and getting fitful sleep. Around 7 am, I suddenly realized I felt fine. I checked on everyone else, and they were rousing themselves, feeling okay as well. Whatever had been given to us seemed to run its course then disappeared completely.

My heart skipped a beat as I thought this was going to be the part where the taxi driver robbed us. Much to my delight, he took us back to the hotel and just charged us he regular cab fare. I thanked him and we made it up to the room, where we were sick all night. We finally got some sleep after several hours of being sick. I woke up first and got out of bed and realized I felt fine.

I don't see Peanut and I start to think my daughter is just going through the grieving stage when I hear a cry. All of a sudden Peanut comes running to the fence, crying and wagging his tail in joy. I greet him with all the affection in the world as he had been gone for three months already. The man who owns the house hears the fuss and comes outside. I thank him for finding my dog and taking good care of him but he insists that he had the dog for years and that I can't have him. I tell him that this is none other than my dog and all we have to do is check the chip to verify. He is having none of it and calls the police. I tell him that he is more than welcome and that will help solve the situation sooner. The police arrive and hear the story for themselves.

It all started about 3 months ago when I took my doggo Pips to the local dog park. After running around with her for about 15  minutes, I noticed that Pips slowing down. She took a couple of breaks before quitting and sat down for a rest. Now this was a little odd because Pips has been an active dog since a pup. I call Pips up and tell her to fetch me her favorite toy bunny. After looking at me and the her toy she gets up slowly, I notice that she's arching her back in a weird way and limps to the toy. At that moment, I could have kicked myself because that wasn't my dog. Pips was hurting and my guilt rose quickly because being her momma, I should have noticed it as soon as she sat down the first time. But Pips being the people pleaser she was, obeyed my command. It was that moment when I made a call to our Vet where I was told to bring Pips first thing in the morning. When we arrived at the vet, the Doctor did the usual checks and vitals. The doctor claimed it was some kind of back injury and prescribed Pips some pain meds and suggested some weird exercises and stretches to do with her. I was told that the I would be called for a follow up soon.  It's been 4 weeks and no calls or answers from the doctor. Pips has lost weight and the pain meds have ran out. I tried the exercises and Pips howls out in pain! We can't sleep and I cannot bare to see Pips in pain anymore! I have to carry her everywhere and I have already missed too many days at work! I am currently looking for another vet I can trust. If I don't, I have no clue what will happen to Pips.

Prior months to this date all 3 of my dogs were fine and healthy, running and playing like any normal dogs would and should. One day in May my Black Lab started to limp slightly but nothing to serious and worrisome, considering my 3 dogs played rough and wild we thought it was just a minor injury. A week went by and the limp was getting noticeably worse. My mom and i became concerned and soon after called and schedule a Vet appointment for the following week. The day finally came to take my dog, to the vet, thinking it was a minor issue my vet gave her a quick look and basically said she was fine and just hurt her back jumping. At that point i was not to concerned thinking he knew exactly what he was talking about. Another week went by and the limp got even worse. Again we took her back to the Vet, this time he had done an X-ray. Days later the results of the X-ray came back and he said she had a slight disc slip in her back, that has been there a while but nothing that should be causing the limp, he gave her medication for inflammation and sent us on our way. A few days went by and at this point nothing he gave her was helping and no answers that we were looking for came about. Finally we decided to take her to a specialist Vet who does all kind of blood testing and jelly scans and better testing. My family and I walked in that day to the specialist thinking that we were going to pay for our dog to get any surgery she needed to help her limp. After hours of waiting for her blood test results and scan results we finally got our answer, our dog had cancer. We were crush, our lives were shattered the moment we heard she had spleen cancer. For a single moment we were excited to find out that surgery could be done for 10 thousand dollars that we were 100000% willing to pay, but only if the cancer has not spread into her lymph nodes. Upon a few further tests the Vets found that it had spread all through out her body and lymph nodes. That night and the next day we said our goodbyes at that point she was no longer able to walk. This was the worst day of my life, i cry everyday still thinking about her. My life forever changed this day, my attention is constantly with my other 2 dogs who lost their best friend. We buried her in our yard with a beautiful cross and her name on it, she will never be forgotten.",5,"This is about a day that seemed to be a normal visit to my vets office for a limp, that turned into a 2month long nightmare.

My wife and daughter had never been to the Rocky Mountains either, so it was sure to be a treat. We stayed with my wife's cousin and were there primarily to visit my wife's aunt. She has very sick and moved from Chicago to Boulder in order to live a more comfortable life. The first full day were were in Colorado we were taken to the Rocky Mountain National Park. Unlike the typical park in a city setting, this was a huge, and I mean huge area, covering a vast majority of the Rocky Mountain range. My wife's aunt was able to come with, using her scooter, so it was nice spending our day with her also. She had only been to the lower portion of the park, so we were determined to get her to the top-most visitor's center in the park. After an hour and a half or so, we finally made it. We were able to buy some souvenirs and eat a nice lunch with my wife's cousin and aunt. It was a great lunch, and was the closest I had been to nature in a long, long time. After the long drive back, my wife, daughter, and I went white water rafting! None of us had done anything like that before, so it was quite exciting. My daughter and I sat in the front of the raft, with my wife sitting behind my daughter. No sooner had we left the shore, my wife fell in! She was ""rescued"" but soured for the rest of the ride. We kept her spirits up and we powered through nice category IV and category V rapids! She made it the rest of the way and although she was a trooper after having fallen in, she vowed never, ever, to do anything even close to resembling that again. After we finished, we were bused back to our start point, drove back to my wife's cousin's house and went to bed after a very long, exhausting, yet fulfilling day.",2,"We spent a vacation day visiting Rocky Mountain National Park.

It was truly an awe inspiring trip. We drove through twisting roads, climbing ever higher, until we finally reached a height of over 11,000 feet. During the trip we were able to pull over at a number of spots to take photos of the breathtaking scenery. In Boulder, at the base of the Rocky Mountains, it was nearly 95 degrees, but at elevation the temperature was in the low 40s, which was quite shocking when climbing out of our SUV to take photos. Just before we arrived at the highest gift shop/restaurant it began to rain quite hard, then changed to sleet as we ran for cover. It was quite different from the 95 degree heat we had left only an hour and a half earlier. Looking around at the snow capped mountains, some snow only a few dozen feet from where we were standing, demonstrated the ecological diversity that one can experience without having to leave the United States. It was truly amazing eating lunch with my family and looking out at the snow on the Rocky Mountains. We were able to get our fill of souvenirs which we stock up on every vacation so we can easily remember the places we've been and the things we did. Later in the day, after the long drive down from the national park, we took our chances with white water rafting. Our family had never been rafting before, let alone in rapids. We had a spectacular time. While the air temperature at river level was still in the 90s, the cold water felt refreshing with every rapid. Being at one with nature and being able to spend an entire day experiencing some of the best that nature has to offer made me incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to enjoy it with my family.",3,"We spent a vacation day visiting Rocky Mountain National Park.

We started off the day by cooking up some food and having a nice cookout on this day. We had some burgers and some typical 4th of July foods. We spent the day together as a family really just having a nice time together talking and catching up. Then it started to get darker outside and we began to shoot off some fireworks. All of our neighbors also take part in this as there really is a fireworks show right above our house.  We took her outside and at first she acted a bit scared because of all the noise. After a little bit though she relaxed and began to enjoy seeing all of the lights in the sky and hearing the noise. She was really having a great time seeing all of these things for the very first time and it reminded me how much something like this can mean. It took me back and made me enjoy the 4th more than I have in a long time. I really enjoyed watching how she reacted to each huge firework that exploded in the sky above her head. She was throwing her hands in the air and screaming in joy about how much fun she was having with all of this. We really had a great time on this 4th showing this little girl what this holiday was all about. She had a great experience with the entire thing and really enjoyed her first one.

When the doctor arrived, she didn't have a gloomy expression on her face, so I felt hopeful. She said that I had kidney stones. I immediately felt better, even though kidney stones are serious. I didn't know that radiologists look over all the scans the machine does. I thought they only got involved if it was a very serious disease. I told her that I felt better after using the bathroom, and she said that it was possible I already passed the kidney stone. Just to be sure, she gave me medications to shrink any stones and to help heal quicker. I was so relieved after that. I felt like I had a new lease on life, and decided to commit myself to eating healthier and drinking much more water.",3,"I felt a sharp pain in my back and had to go to the emergency room.

She was the kind of person that was a bit reserved, but we convinced her to have the party after a bit of prodding and promising not the go too far (*fingers crossed*). The setting for the party was a hotel in a nearby town, and about 20 people were there to celebrate. As soon as the person of the night came, the drink were being slung, and the party was jamming. It was about 70 minutes into the party that things started to get a bit crazy. One of our friends saw when she came into the hotel that a buggy was parked in the parking lot of the hotel. We all thought it would be fun to leave the hotel room and to drive around town enjoying the starry night sky.  We didn't have a care in the world at that point, and the bride-to-be was completely into the whole thing. I'd never seen her as into something as she was at that moment sitting next to me in that buggy driving through town in the dead of night.  But things soon turned a bit serious when we ran into a group of guys returning from a hike. These were college aged guys, so they were young and, admittedly, a bit handsome. They saw how tipsy we were and probably thought we were an easy lay. Alcohol and cautious thinking don't mix, so a few of our friends who were very drunk decided to go with the guys to party before heading home. It  wasn't until the next morning that we heard what happened. Apparently, they woke up feeling like they were given something other than alcohol. They fear that they may have been assaulted, so they went to the police to file a report. Hopefully nothing happened, but they haven't gave me or anyone else in our group an update since they filed that police report.",5,"This was my friend's bachelorette party where we rode a huge buggy/bike through the town, while drinking and having a good time.

The Bride to be seemed to be having a great time so no one complained. I was definitely not expecting to pedal around on a little villa that we had to pedal to get around on. The bridesmaids all seemed to be in such great spirits. We got to our first stop in about twenty minutes and we got to peruse the bars in that particular area for about 30 mins. I actually enjoyed the stops more because the seats on the buggy were definitely not the most comfortable. Everyone had a good time for the most part. At the last stop we ended up going into one bar and toasting to the bride. Some guys in a bachelor party actually bought us drinks. That was our mistake. A few of the girls started feeling a little light headed and woozy. We ended up having to get a few ubers to carry us all back to the maid of honors house because two of the girls couldn't walk. We got the girls to bed and kept a super close watch on them. When they woke up the next morning they didn't remember what happened. We didn't realize until the next morning that they were given something in their drinks. We made sure and called and made a report.

My birthday party is tomorrow & my birthday isn’t until Monday. But he wanted to do something with just us. So he bought me an awesome & yummy ice cream cake. I came out of the bathroom & he had it setting on the table with candles & holding the camera with the lights off singing happy birthday. Then he gifted me with a beautful sterling silver & yellow gold heart bracelet! I just wanted to share with you awesome ladies & I hope all the September babies have an amazing birthday!  The surprise was a custom Harley Davidson that I had designed, and he spent 2 years building for me. i was really awesome and great feelings. i was really happy.  Well my birthday isn't until next week but my husband usually surprises me early because I don't expect it...actually I am catching on lol. We went to the mall and had food court lunch. I was good, I ate at the cafe that has salads and such. I had one of his french fried with ketchup and I couldn't believe how intense the saltiness was. I haven't had a lot of salt in the past few weeks so it was intense salt taste. I wanted to give him something really special and personal for Christmas (I believe it was our second or third Christmas together). I reflected back on gifts that my loved ones had given me through the years and decided that my absolute favorite gift was the photo album of my life that my parents put together for me. Given that my husband's parents had died several years before we met, I thought it would be the perfect way for me to get to know him and a beautiful memento of his life that he would cherish forever. I spent hours after work secretly rifling through a box of photos I found, gathering the best shots of him, his family, his homes and his beloved dogs. I hoped he wouldn't see any part of my project before it was over since I wanted him to be totally surprised. I took pride and delight in my project. My heart overflowed with love and I could hardly wait for Christmas morning when he would open it and laugh, cry, and appreciate me all the more.",2,"My husband surprised me with an early birthday present.

I was so surprised, I really had no idea he had even been working on it. WHen he rode it up the driveway I was literally in shock! He hopped off, and told me to jump on. The best part was when I straddled the bike and twisted the throttle... it was so loud and felt overwhelmingly powerful! I was completely exhilarated! I think this was probably the most surprising birthday present I have ever received in my entire life. I was totally blindsided, and felt such love and gratitude to my husband at that moment. We have had a rough couple of years in our marriage, and he hasn't been the most supportive husband during that time. Knowing that he took the time and energy to build that bike for me, really made me feel loved by him, and definitely went a long way in making up for some of the negative things that have happened between us. I would have to say that this act of kindness and devotion went a long way in making me feel more secure in his feelings for me and our future together in general. I know one thing is for sure, it will be very hard for him (or anyone), to ever top this surprise birthday gift. I really am still in shock over it months later. Unfortunately it's getting too cold to ride now, but I can still go out to the garage and see my bike and feel the overwhelming sense of pride I have for owning such a beautiful machine, and knowing that I have a husband who truly loves me very much.

Although my birthday is coming up in a couple of weeks, I really hadn't put much thought into it at all. I know Billy won't be here, and to be honest at my age birthdays don't really mean much anyway. So, here's what happened. We were all sitting down eating supper and Billy called. He talked to Veronica, who hung up the phone and told me something was going on and we were to meet him in the driveway. I put on my shoes, and followed her out to wait for him to arrive. After about 20 minutes, I heard what I thought was his motorcycle coming up the driveway. Sure enough, it was him. I was so concerned about what was going on I didn't even see what was happening right in front of my eyes. There he was, sitting on the bike right in front of me, grinning from ear to ear; It was MY bike!!! The one I had designed and was in the works for over 2 years!! I had no idea he had even been working on it and here it was, finished and in all its glory! It was gorgeous. Painting in black and my favorite shade of blue, lowered almost all the way to the ground, and sounding like a beast! Harley Davidson custom at it's finest! I was absolutely elated. Billy sat there with a shit-eating grin from one ear to the other, knowing he was a champion. He told me Happy Birthday, and that he loved me very much. He wanted me to have a very special birthday present this year because he wasn't going to be able to be here for my birthday, and felt terrible about it. I love this man! He is such a fantastic, loving, and supportive husband. To think he went out of his way to work so hard for weeks to get this project finished just to make me happy and see me smile. I am still very sad that he won't be here for my special day, but I have to admit he cushioned the blow a great deal with this fabulous surprise.

The most magical part of the wedding was after our ceremony. We just barely had enough time to finish family photos before it started to rain over the mountains. We all ran inside and then to the pavilion. I remember standing there looking at the rain coming over the mountains and I was in awe.

They always were together and were travelers of the world. For some reason unknown to us that where they always chose to be in the winters. They would rent a cabin in the mountains and stay there for months at the time after their retirement. Seems like they chose that spot to rest so we figured what better spot to rest for eternity.    As we hiked up the mountain we told countless stories about her life. One of my favorites was when i first met her. She though i was a handy man and started telling me all the work that needed to be done around my then girlfriends house.

We hiked up a trail in the Colorado National Monument, near Grand Junction Colorado, to one of her favorite spots to visit.  It took about half an hour to get there.  It was my first time going, but my wife and kids had gone before when my mother in law was not sick.  When we got to the spot, a large cliff overlooking the area, we took a few minutes to look around and enjoy the scenery.  Then we found a small juniper tree that sat near the edge, and my father in law spread the ashes around the base.  My kids hung up some trinkets they had brought that reminded them of their grandma, and everyone had brought a stone from her collection to stack on the spot.  After we had done this, my father in law sat down and started crying.  It was hard to watch, as he had never displayed that kind of emotion around me before.  My older daughter sat down next to him and they just sat there for a while and looked out on the valley ahead of them.  She was the most in tune with her grandfather of all the grandchildren.  She was the oldest, and had recently spent several months living with her grandparents, and had really grown to be close with them. After they had sat for a while and came to terms with the moment, we went to one of my mother in law's favorite mexican restaurants to have dinner.  We all talked about the memories we had of her, and her personality traits that stood out.  My wife had a peach margarita in her honor, as that was one of her favorite drinks.",1,"After my mother in law died, my wife's family and our family hiked up to a favorite spot in the Colorado National Monument to spread her ashes.

We went to the local bar that night to celebrate. I think it was a Buffalo Wild Wings, which was great because that is one of my favorite places to eat, I really love their wings. We were watching the Lakers game on one of the big screen TVs there, and just having a good time while eating some wings and also having a few drinks. The Lakers were really destroying the Clippers that night, and by the third quarter they had a 20 point lead, so our cheers and laughter only got louder. All of a sudden, in the middle of the third quarter, we saw someone on the opposite side of the bar get up angrily and began walking towards us. He had a Clippers jersey on, so we had a pretty good idea why he was so upset. He stood next to us, and told my friend specifically to shut his ""Stupid big fat mouth"". I was pretty amazed that someone could be so belligerent over a meaningless regular season NBA game, so I was speechless for a moment. Then I asked the man what his problem was and why he was so upset at the game. He told my friend and I that were just bandwagon fans, and only liked the Lakers because they traded for Anthony Davis. I told him that he was clearly drunk and should just shut up and go home. To my surprise, he actually did leave without saying much else after that. His outburst really ruined the night, though, and it made me forget that we were supposed to be celebrating my friend's birthday. Instead, I was focused on why my friend didn't stand up for himself and say anything. He just told me that he was too nervous because he didn't want to potentially get into a fight, so I left it at that and we went home afterwards.",1,The man insult my friend so i am not interested in my friend birthday.I was eagerly went to ask the reason for the insult.

The poor little guy needed 13 stitches and has a limp now. Our big dog, Brutus, has shown some aggressive tendencies before, but this was something else. My husband is pretty frustrated and unsure about what to do. I called a local training place that specializes in aggressive dogs like Brutus, and they suggested giving him anti-depressants for the time being. He is scheduled to stay there for an extended time starting on Monday. I'm worried because when I met with the head specialist they indicated that Brutus might have to be put down if he cannot control his aggression. This would absolutely break my heart if it ends up happening. I know my husband would really struggle too since Brutus was his dog from before we met and moved in together. He's taking it pretty hard already. We just have to cross our fingers and hope Brutus can learn how to be a bit more chill in the future.

We have two dogs. One is a hound mix around 60 pounds, Roxy. Our other dog is a terrier mix around 30 pounds, Sadie, and she has a seizure disorder. They both recently just turned three and have spent the majority of their lives together. We adopted Sadie at three months, and Roxy at six months. Sadie developed a seizure disorder and would have seizures at night about once a month, and they are cluster seizures so they happen a few times within a 24-hour period. Roxy usually sleeps in her kennel downstairs at night so she hasn't been around the seizures. Starting six months ago, Sadie's seizures have progressed and happen every two weeks now and during the day as well. Starting six months ago, Roxy would attack Sadie during her seizures. We thought at first she was trying to help, but then it got worse. Last Friday night, everything seemed fine and it was gorgeous weather outside so we took the dogs for a walk. Roxy attacked Sadie in the woods behind our house even though Sadie was not having a seizure. Sadie is doing okay, we took her to the vet on Monday when they opened and she got some shots and cleaned up. We don't know what to do with Roxy though. Most likely we will have to put her down. I'm so upset and disturbed, this is one of the most difficult things I've ever done. I love them both to pieces. I wish I could re-home Roxy but we don't know anyone who can take her and our vet said she will probably be put down at a shelter. It's just an ugly and very unpleasant situation.

It's inspiring to talk with her and hear her positive outlook on various things in life. Though it's inevitable that Kara will no longer be a part of my life in a few years, I cherish the time that we can spend together. That's why this card was so meaningful. It showed that she feels exactly the same way about our friendship. Kara doesn't always get a ton of visitors due to her age, so it's a bit sad when other patients have large gatherings of families to see them.

Avoid foods with lots of sugar or saturated fats like sweets, chocolate and red meat. Carbohydrates things like bread, rice, potatoes and pasta can be easier to eat when she feeling nauseous. If possible keep away from triggers food or smells that make she feel sick I can by elastic acupressure wristbands from most pharmacies. These bands have a plastic button that presses on the acupressure point on the wrist and it may help relieve the nausea. This can be challenging especially if she were not ready to tell your colleagues about her pregnancy. If she feel very ill its probably a good idea to tell her manager at work at work that she were pregnant but you don't have to. If she do decide to tell them about her pregnancy this is a good time to talk about any changes to her work that help. For example she might need easier access to a toilet. Or if smells from the kitchen or canteen are triggering her sickness maybe she could move some where else until she feel better. Try not to worry too much about people knowing she was pregnant its more important to look after herself. If she was vomiting several times a day or are not able to eat and drink at all without being sick she may be dehydrated which is why she feel so bad.

It was the first wedding I had ever been too as an adult, and also felt super close to the people getting married. The morning was great.

It has been a while since I had a computer, and since I didn't have one, it made no sense to have an internet connection.

When I am depressed, I have no desire to see what friends are doing especially if something wonderful is happening in their lives like getting married. Knowing that marriage is so far for me, I can not relate. But if I were to be totally honest, I am jealous. Jealous that they, seemingly, have normal lives. Some days I can hardly get our of bed because of the depression. My boyfriend has been so patient with me. He is a great friend and is always there for me when I can't be there for myself. Surprisingly, we met at Barnes and Noble. About 6 months ago, I was in the self-help section and he was looking for a book for his graduate studies in psychology. I did not notice him at first but smelled cigarettes and followed my nose to a thin man with a beard. I gave him on of those once overs, starting at the flash of red hair (oh how I love gingers). The beard was slightly more brown than his hair and his eyes were bright blue wearing tortoise shell Raybans. Moving down I noticed he was quite muscular despite his smallish stature. I stand 5 feet on a good day and he was a few feet taller. Wearing a white V-neck and perfectly fitted Levis, he somehow intrigued me. I moved a little closer to see if I could detect, through the cigarette smell, the cologne he was wearing. Yep, there is was, Aqua de Gio. My favorite and one that totally turns me on. I am getting slightly turned on now as I am writing this. What surprised me most was when he noticed me and asked me how my day was going. I blushed a little and said ""Great, now"". He asked me to have coffee with him in the Starbucks at the book store and as they say...""the rest is history"".",4,Four months ago I was depressed and my new boyfriend spent time helping me to feel better.

Within the last 6 months we have had a chance to get to know each other more. There have been some amazing ups and some heart aching downs. We are both emotional people that like to hide behind the confidence that we have in ourselves. It is refreshing when we both choose to be open and share how we really feel. A moment like that happened about four months ago. I was feeling down about my recent work experiences and slightly depressed due to memories of some past traumatic experiences. During this moment, he spent extra time with me doing simple things. We ate dinner together, watched movies at home and had long conversations. One night he stayed around and let me read a book to him. I really enjoyed his presence and appreciated the effort he put into assisting me to feel better. But I still was down. I am a bit of a nerd and enjoy technology. When he and I met I told him how I wished I had a laptop at home and internet connection and how it would make me happy. I guess he remembered after all those months. A month goes by of feeling down and out of the blue he suggest, ""Hey lets get you a laptop and I can provide internet connection."" I was shocked, that idea was not on my mind. When I am depressed I don't think much of what I can do to improve my life. I loved the idea and I felt as if the clouds in my rolled away and revealed sunshine. We decided on a laptop, split the cost and he provided me with a hot spot for internet service.

It was strenuous and tiring, all for a job that is supposed to be relatively simple. My trainers were not trained in the subject matter themselves and have never worked in this position. Because of that, they had a hard time going over the subject matter with us as a class and it was painful to witness them struggle. I regret the entire experience, as I was offered a better position some weeks later with a better pay amount and less stressful training. It took SO LONG to complete, every training class was 3 hours long and we did several classes a day. The organizers were incompetent, and this was a mistake by far. I learned my lesson and so far I am much happier in my new position. I have made many friends and feel competent in the training I have received thus far.

It was entirely basic stuff like how to sign in, but we had to do it step by step, and could NOT skip ahead.

It feels like yesterday because her passing was so painful for me. She was suffering so much, and I felt guilty feeling like her passing was a relief at the time. While her passing away was a relief because she wasn't suffering anymore, I feel totally lost and lonely without her. I viewed my grandma as my mom because she raised me from the time that I was born. I feel so alone now. My own mother couldn't handle motherhood, so my grandma filled that role for me. Actually saying she filled that role is a huge understatement. She devoted herself (emotionally and time) entirely to me. I have memories of her when I was young coming to all of my school events, and cheering me on at sports events. She talked me through hard times with friends and boyfriends as I got older. She also encouraged me to work hard in school which I did. Due to her encouragement, I got into college and she paid for everything. I did really well in college, and immediately got a job I love right after graduation. I feel really sad because I am not married yet, and always dreamed that she would meet my future husband and children. I am still in shock that she died so quickly because I always viewed her as a healthy person. She went to all of her physicals, and it seemed like her cancer came out of nowhere.

She raised me since I was a baby and I called her mom. She was my best friend. She died suddenly to an extent. She was diagnosed with lung cancer in August and she was fine up until then she just went downhill I go a phone call from the hospital where she was admitted and she died. I took care of her through it all.  I just feel so lonely and lost right now what will I do. I hear something on the news and that i know she be interested in even though the last week she was in the hospital I call her or tell her when I got to the hospital. I find myself thinking of her constantly and wondering will this pain ever subside. I question why do we die I know there are reasons I know when it’s your time it’s your time and when your job is done it’s done.  I am not ready to let go. I wanted you to stay with me. I wanted you to watch my children grow up and Arianna poor, little Arianna she already been through so much in her short life with heart surgery and cancer she now has to grieve for you. Maria- Eve is only four but she loved you so much and will miss you playing with her and giving her those frappes from McDonald's that keep her up at night and watching horror, movies she really loved you she was your little buddy. I just had a baby on August 5th Leilani you helped chose her name and now she will be too little to even remember how much you lived her. I have the memories though of you changing her evening though you were sick you still wanted to and she pooped in your hand. Then you changed her again and she pooped on you again. You thought it was funny and gross at the same time. I wonder now who in this world I will ever trust as much as you to watch them. You were my rock I love you and I miss you so much. I wish you knew how much I truly cared for you. You were my best friend and even though we had some doozy of arguments we always made up. I miss you, mom mom and I don’t think that this pain will ever go away, At least I can think of all the time s we shared like last Thanksgiving when the stove broke we made spaghetti on a hot plate till the new one there. I wonder if you were sick then and maybe if the doctors checked your lungs they would have found it but they just keep saying you had a sinus infection and now you are gone. I miss you so much I truly do and now I have to go but I am so scared and lost without you I truly love you.",5,My grand-mother passed away on October 14th.

The day was going pretty normal at first. We where getting ready for the wedding with my brother. The guys in the wedding where in one place and the girls where in another place like normal during weddings. We where all getting ready having a good time together when we noticed that one of the guys in the party was missing. It started to get closer and closer to the time we need together to start the ceremony. We had some people looking for him. After hours of searching he was finally found later in a closet passed out from drinking too much. This was really bad and we knew that it wouldnt be a good thing for him to be in it. I think all of us where disappointed in him. Although this may have been the case we realized that things happen. We ended up going on with the ceremony and just letting it be. We had a great night and everyone was happy and content with the way it went. This doesn't define the person and I know I realize that but I also hope everyone else did.

My brother and I have been close since I can remember. Life has lead us in different directions and caused us to distant because of his relocation for work. I still feel like he is one of the only people who know me best. So when he asked me to be the best man in his wedding, I was honored. We all gathered before hand, the wedding party just the groom and groomsmen because of the bad luck seeing your spouse and all. We where getting ready and chatting when we suddenly realized one of the groomsman who was one of my brothers friends was not with us. One at time we started calling him on his cell phone. We called and called for around a half hour. The wedding was going to begin in about another hour and a half. We decided to go looking for my brothers friend/groomsmen because we had seen him earlier that day. In fact he was with us when entered the facility the wedding was taking place at. We decided that maybe his phone was dead and we should go search for him. So me and cousin who was also a groomsmen went to look for him. We looked and looked but didnt have any luck. After half an hour we went back to tell my brother we couldnt find him. With about an hour left until wedding things became panicky. About 20 minutes later of chaos and panic we got a call from housekeeping. My brothers friend who is almost 30 years old was passed out drunk in the closet where they keep extra chairs and tables. After he was confronted he began to cry about his drinking problem. This lead to a quick chat about him and who he was and what he needed to do. We didnt have him in the wedding and just went with an uneven number of groomsmen and bridesmaid's. I havent heard from my brothers friend in awhile nor about him but it was very eye opening. It made me realize how fortunate I am to be free of an addiction. He wasnt someone you would expect to go through something like this and I hope he gets better.",3,My brothers wedding party gets shaken up by one his groomsmen. It involved a lot of panic and chaos.

The knuckles of her right hand, however, are white with rage as she clutches her camera. She knows that in a matter of moments, the doors to the sanctuary will be flung open and the first notes of the processional will fill the air. Guests will rise and, as if in unison, arms holding camera phones will extend into the aisle. Those not sitting on the coveted aisle seat will raise their phone or tablet into the air. Not just family and friends, but co-workers and “plus-ones” — people with no vested interest in the bride cramming to get a photograph. Yes, she knows that in a few seconds, the church will be filled with Camera Phone paparazzi, rending her official task impossible. She grips the camera tighter and continues to breathe deep breaths. And then…she sees it. A selfie stick. She isn’t sure to whom it belongs, but it doesn’t matter. It is there, extended midway into the aisle. A Sword of Narcissism extending from the hands of a disrespectful guest. And something deep within her snaps. She gently places her camera on the floor behind her and begins walking down the aisle. She finds she no longer has control over her legs; they refuse to stop. She thinks, for a moment, if this is how it feels to be possessed. An almost out of body experience. She watches with fascination as a hand she recognizes as her own reaches out and yanks the selfie stick from its surprised owner. She grasps it with both hands and holds it high above her head, much the same way one would when presenting an item of tribute. And then, in one swift move, she raises her knee and brings the selfie stick down, breaking it in two. With a deep sigh of satisfaction, she hands both pieces back to the startled owner and makes her way triumphantly to her position at the front of the church. She will never photograph another wedding after this. Rumors of her instability will spread far and wide. But within the wedding photography community, tales of her heroic deed will be whispered with reverence, songs will be created in her honor, and her name submitted to the Vatican for Sainthood.",1,I was at my friends wedding and it was beautiful.

The decor was absolutely amazing. During the ceremony, they had flower petals lining the aisles. The procession started with my friend, the groom, and his parents. He looked amazing in a navy blue tuxedo with a light pink tie. It was very classy. After the bridesmaids and groomsmen walked down the aisle, it was time for the bride and her father to enter. Everyone stood up and turned their heads as the bride walked into the hall. She was absolutely beautiful; stunning from head to toe. Her dress was barely touching the ground, yet her veil had a four foot train behind her. The whole ceremony only lasted about twenty minutes, and was well officiated by one of our close friends. After that, the wedding party headed to the banquet hall next door for a few drinks and appetizers. Luckily, it was open bar so I didn't have to pay for a glass of wine. An hour or so later, everyone settled into their seats as the DJ announced the new couple. They had their first dance, as well as the mother-son and father-daughter dances. Dinner came out shortly after the best man and maid of honor made their speeches. I ordered the steak, and it was cooked to perfection. After I ate, I had a couple more cocktails and that's when the real fun began. We danced for a few hours, and celebrated the new couples nuptials. Overall, it was amazing, and it was a great way to connect with all my friends at the wedding.",1,I was at my friends wedding and it was beautiful. I am the one that took picture.

I then started taking pictures of the wedding party and they looked so beautiful and it was a very pretty wedding. I then waited on the bride to come in and I started taking pictures of her and the groom and there very first moments together.

I think I done a great job it was a very emotional day and a lot of crying but I think my pictures showed great emotions in that day. Her husband was so happy when she came down the isal and it was so sweet. It was a very long day but a very well worth it day. I took a lot of very nice pictures of her and him together and of there family together. I love the part of them coming out of the church. They really showed of they felt after they go married. They had a wonderful ceremony after the wedding and there was a lot of food and dancing. They don't the flower toss and they cut the cake a feed each other. she was even given a house to live it and that showed a lot of emotions to. With me telling the story I think if I could show pictures it would show you more emotions. They got to go in a old jeep and that was kind of neat seeing them leave on that jeep. They even made sure to wave at everybody and we started cleaning up once they left. This was one of the pretest wedding I have been to in a wail. They had everything perfect even though I thought we were going to be a little late with pictures. They even had this at a church with a pond. They knew exactly what they wanted and how they wanted this and so we were justing waiting on some of the grooms men. Some of them where running late and I was trying not to be unhappy but I was get scared like I wasn't having enough time to do all the pictures.

Even now, it still feels so surreal to me. Martial Arts was never something I saw myself pursuing professionally. My father owned a dojo, and as a child, I would spend a majority of my weekends training with him. I thought it was a mere hobby to me, more than anything, but my father had always told me that I had the talents to go further. I didn't take his advice, though. The amount of time I spent training, dwindled when I graduated high school and entered college. About a year ago, a friend of mine happened to stumble upon an ad on Facebook about the tournament and brought it to my attention. At that moment, I heard my father's words echo in the back of my head, and I decided to give it a shot! I trained hard for months. It was both the most difficult and rewarding period of my life. There were times where I was on the brink of giving up and dropping out of the tournament completely. At other times, I felt on top of the world and extremely confident. On the days leading up to my first match, I was very nervous. You have no idea how happy I was when I won. Hard work really does pay off! The entire experience was euphoric for me, and I realized that instead of a hobby, Jiu Jitsu, may have been a forgotten passion for me!",1,I trained hard for a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu tournament.

I was inspired by the new coach at our gym to compete much more frequently. I had also lost fairly decisively at a tournament in February - I needed redemption. I prepared in several different ways. First, I needed to lose about 5 pounds. This takes a good amount of self-discipline, as your body has a hard time readjusting to a caloric deficit. I removed carbs and also just ate less in general, eating a minimum of protein and veggies necessary. I lost about 7 pounds total and was in great shape. My cardio was another issue. I needed to boost my stamina, as in my previous competition I had biked vigorously but still fatigued. My new strategy was to spar at other gyms as often as I could. Fighting someone unfamiliar to you will make you more competitive and more uneasy, which is exactly what a tournament is. The tournament itself was almost disappointing, as it seemed my opponents did not provide enough of a challenge. Who you fight on the day of will always be random.

It was bad for me but way worse for them. I can deal with water and smoke damage but they lost pretty much everything. Now there is a giant hole in the roof above my apartment. I am lucky in the sense that they were able to put me in a temporary apartment and that I will be fully covered by my renters insurance. My neighbors weren't so lucky. They decided to let their renters insurance lapse and they also lost so much. I don't understand why anyone wouldn't have renters insurance. Especially when you have little hellians living in the same building as you.

One morning, I woke up and did my normal morning routine.  I heard the neighbors upstairs getting ready to leave, as usual.  A few minutes after I heard the mom and kid leave, I heard a really loud noise from up there.  I thought maybe the boyfriend had dropped something heavy.  I didn't think too much of it because I heard footsteps afterward and figured all was well.  About 5 to 10 minutes later, there was loud banging on my front door and people yelling outside.  The apartment above mine was on fire and I had to get my son up and get out. It seems as though the neighbor's boyfriend did something to set the fire, which is probably the noise I had heard.  It burned really hot and fast.  My apartment became unlivable due to water and smoke damage, so we were forced to move to another apartment.  We are now almost settled into our new apartment.  It has been difficult to manage, and we still need to replace some of the furniture we lost.  We could have filed a personal property insurance claim, but most of what was lost wasn't really worth anything since it was second-hand older items for the most part. I can't help but to keep thinking about it.  I wonder what might have happened if I had slept late that day.  I don't know that we would have been okay if I wasn't awake, or if it had burned just a little faster.",4,"There was a bad fire in the apartment above mine, likely set on purpose.

I had been being nagged by my wife for weeks before about the wine that she had wanted from a specialty store up state.

I work in Vancouver and I have an exciting relative in the US who have always wanted me to come around. He told me a lot about New York where he stays and I have since then been wanting to have a view of the big city. So six months ago, after receiving my paid leave, I planned for my New York trip. I packed more than enough clothes as I can't be so sure which one I will feel like wearing. I had another suitcase for my shoes. I needed to show the world I can be very fashionable than that nerd they see on suit. In it was all sort of shoe type; sneakers, brogue, slip on, vans, boot. I booked a flight for New York and I printed the online invoice. Gave my dog to the neighbor for safe keeping till I'm back. Fast forward to New York, I had a nice stay there; the food, the city lights, the busy streets and all made it so much an enjoyable experience. I didn't know it was about to turn sour when on the day I was to leave for the airport and fly home, there was a heavy gridlock. The traffic was so locked that I silently prayed it should be free. I arrived at the airport some 10 minutes after the schedule time. I knew I have missed my flight to Vancouver. I walked up to the receptionist and explained my ordeal to her. She keyed into my plight as she understood it might cost me my job as I stayed a day to my resumption. She fixed me up to the next flight which wasn't a direct flight but will still take me to Vancouver. I was happy that such people still exist. She said ""You today, Me tomorrow"". That line will stick with me forever.",3,I missed my flight back to New York from Vancouver. I didn't have enough money to buy a new ticket.

I was flying from Vancouver, Canada back to my hometown in New York. I was in Vancouver for a Spring internship that lasted four months. So needless to say, I was carrying a lot of stuff. I had two enormous suitcases and my carry-on backpack. Unfortunately, for me, I woke up late on the day of my flight. My flight was scheduled to leave at 6 am. I woke up at four-thirty and raced to the airport. Nonetheless, it was too late. I was stranded. I had already spent most of my money on rent and food during the internship. I didn't have a credit card, only a debit card with a purchase limit of $100 and $40 in cash. This was not enough to pay a new flight back to New York. I was sure that I was going to have to spend the night at the airport until I could get a hold of my parents. I told my story to a West Jet agent, I'll call Mike. Mike was a godsend. He spoke to his supervisor and pulled some strings to get me on the next flight back to NYC. I only paid $50 for the extremely discounted ticket. I was so happy and grateful. That was one of the few times in my life that I've seen someone truly go out of their way to help someone in need.",4,I missed my flight back to New York from Vancouver.

I told Rob about what Bill did. I let him know why I had such trouble opening up and why I was always just a little bit scared even when things seemed perfect. I thought he would see me differently. Instead he decided to open up to me. His last girlfriend had passed away in a car wreck about 3 years ago and that's why he could be a bit clingy at times. OMG I had no clue! Poor Rob!

The humidity, our two-year-old son and one-year-old Jack Russell Terrier had long begun to wear on her two-weeks-overdue body. To our delight, that crescendo of fatigue, discomfort and anticipation was short lived. Baby Abigail, ""Abbie"" (or as we call her ""Abbie P"" - the P is for ""peanut"") was born In early September, just in time to cut short our Labor Day picnic. Abbie's brother, Sam, fell in love with his baby sister from the moment he laid eyes on her. I would hold her down where he could go nose to nose with her but not get too rough. Sometimes when Pam was breastfeeding, Sam would give them both a knowing grin, as it was in the not too far distant past that he enjoyed such nutritive and bonding moments with his mom. Vivian the Jack Russell went bonkers when she saw the new addition to her little people posse. More than once we found her resting her head on Abbie's carrier, gazing at her as she slept, with a longing look for the day that Abbie would be able to scoot around like Sam. Pam and I are, needless to say, overjoyed. We wanted one of each, a family of four. In fact, the day we met in Westerly 5 years ago, we talked about how many children each of us would like to have and our answers matched. Funny for a first encounter, perhaps, but the beach was warm, the drinks were colorful and tequila-heavy, and our mutual group of friends decided love and marriage would be the topic on such a sultry day. Today our cocktails have become coffee, the dark roast blend we need to answer the call of kid and canine alike. When the kids get a little older, we'd like to buy a little summer cottage on one of the side streets near Misquamicut. They can build castles in the sand, the dog can catch a Frisbee, and Pam and I can happily remember the first day of the start of our family, again and again.",1,Four months ago my family welcomed the arrival of our second child.

I finally found a BMW 328i close enough to ride my bike to see. I contacted the seller and made plans to see it that Sunday. I had been withdrawing cash every week to be sure I had enough to buy a car when I found one but I needed enough money in my bank account to cover the cost of insurance so I'd be able to drive it home. On Thursday I made certain to transfer the funds I needed well before the cutoff time. A little while later I got an email that the transfer failed. I found a reddit thread stating others were having the same problem. The withdrawal had to be done before about 5:00 or I knew it wouldn't be in my account. I tried throughout the day every 30 to 45 minutes or so hoping it would work. finally just before 4:30 the transfer finally went through. On Friday I checked my balance and found that instead of depositing my withdrawal once I had every single attempted withdrawal deposited to my account. I wasn't sure what to do since I now had over 400 extra dollars in my account and a negative balance in my Amazon payments account. I didn't know when the money might be taken out or whether they would only take the extra money or reverse it all and correct it with another deposit. The advice I kept getting was to not touch the money until it was figured out. I felt like I was in limbo and was extremely frustrated. I contacted the seller and told him I wouldn't be able to meet Sunday but if he still had it next weekend I would come get it. After a few days I finally received an email from Amazon confirming the error and that funds would not be removed from anyone's bank account. Unfortunately they weren't clear about what would happen to our Amazon payments account. I confirmed with the seller I would be able to come see the car that weekend and we set a time. One day I found the car was no longer listed and asked if it was sold. The seller replied that he had a flat tire he wasn't able to change and found the car had been towed from the apartment building he parked it at. My heart sank I felt a great opportunity had slipped out of my hands due to bad luck and felt a little bit hopeless about finding a vehicle. Amazon sent an email on Thursday stating the incorrect balance had been resolved and that the extra funds were ours to keep as an apology for the inconvenience I was completely floored that I just got a gift of over $400. A few days later I found a 525i that was listed for only a couple hundred more than the one I was planning to buy and it was a newer model by four years plus the interior looked new and the body was in pretty good condition with no major issues. After checking it over and test driving it I wound up negotiating with the guy for 100 less than the car I was previously going to buy so I wound up with $400 extra dollars and a car that was one model range up and four years newer for less money.,2,An Amazon payments screw up by Amazon left my bank account in limbo.

I can't believe I still feel so depressed about all of them leaving; it still feel so painful to me when I think about it. It's been so hard adjusting to not getting to see her all the time and almost worse is not getting to spend so much time with my niece and nephew. They're at that age where they're not really kids anymore but young adults and I was so looking forward to helping through the transition into adulthood. I understand why Sis had to leave, she had a great job opportunity that would make all of their lives better, but I just really feel left behind. I did finally make that therapy appointment I promised myself I would do. I go to my first appointment in three days. I'm actually looking forward to it and I really hope it will help me put things in perspective and sort of find a new thing to find more meaning in my life. I've been going out more with my friends and that's helps a lot for me to feel connected and like I still have a ""family"" around me, even though they aren't technically family. They've helped a lot since I decided to let more people into my life and try to fill the void left my Sis and kids leaving. Ya' know, as I'm sitting here writing about all of this and thinking about it, I think I should actually just get that plane ticket and plan a vacation to go and see them. They've been asking me to see them and their new place. I've been so depressed about everything that I keep saying no, but I think I probably should go and see them. I'm sure it would be great to see them and I really want to. I guess I'm just worried that when I have to leave all feel terrible all over again. I think I'll talk about this in my therapy appointment. I'm also really open to any suggestions the therapist has on how I can turn this situation around and make something, anything, really good come out of this.

But now I think it's time...About 3 months ago my husband's brother, Jerry, came to stay with us at our house.  He told us he wanted to get off drugs, and that rehab didn't work and wasn't for him.  He'd been before and, obviously, it didn't work.  My husband is close with his brother so he, of course, let him stay with us.  I didn't think it was a good idea, but I supported the decision, even though I thought it might be dangerous to have a drug addict in our house. As I suspected, things didn't turn out well.  Over the course of a few weeks Jerry grew increasingly hostile as he detoxed.  He got really ill from the withdrawal.  I didn't realize it could take so long.  Anyway, he wasn't getting better, and he was getting meaner and meaner.  Everything came to a head when Jerry finally asked my husband to score some dope for him; Jerry was too incapacitated to leave the house and do it himself.  My husband erupted in anger, shouting at him about how we had opened our home to him, tried to help him get off drugs, not perpetuate his habit.  My husband physically threw Jerry out the front door and called the cops.  The police took him away for causing a scene, banging on our front door and yelling in the middle of the night. The whole thing--seeing Jerry get sick and mean, seeing my husband get violent--really unsettles me when I think about it, even now.  My husband is perpetually sorry for the incident and apologized every day.  It's not his fault, and I make sure he knows.

It is the longest paved trail in the USA. It is between ninety to one hundred miles long. About twenty five miles into the bike ride, I flipped over my handlebars and crashed. I cannot remember exactly how it happened. Some people that witnessed the crash say that my back tire skid on something and that caused me to crash. The only thing I remember is realizing that I'm going over my handlebars in slow motion. Before I hit the ground, my head seemed to turn off. So I don't remember my head hitting the ground, fracturing my teeth, using my hands to try to stop my fall or any other parts of the crash. According to the doctor and nurse practitioner, it is perfectly normal to not remember anything before or after the crash. I just felt really lucky that I wore a helmet. I was told that if I did not wear a helmet I would have either been brain dead and in a coma or dead. I did split open an area right above my eye and it required stitches, but I did not have facial fractures, skull fracturing or any brain bleeding. Another great thing is that I did not break my wrists or arms in the fall when I tried to brace my fall. I am really happy that the couple found me and called the ambulance to come get me. The ambulance took me to the hospital and they helped take care of me by doing CT scan and some other tests. The CT scan showed that everything was fine in my brain. I didn't have any bleeding or swelling. I ended up being released from the hospital on the same day. A few days later my right eye was swollen and my lips were swollen from being busted during the fall. I looked terrible but I still decided to go outside and handle my life affairs.

I got excited because that meant there might be decent fishing. We finish our hike (looping back to this bridge again) by mid afternoon. I get my stuff out and rigged up and start tossing bugs. Every offering, this fish beneath the bridge would short strike but never take. I switched to an ant and had my son grab it and let go. I figured it was time to let him cool down because I thought I could catch him on that pattern, but he had seen it too much to take it at that point. I went downstream, fishing the seams and holes I could find. As I walked downstream surrounded by these sequoias 40 feet around, I came to this pool at the end of a run. It looked fishy. You know what feeling when you're fishing new water but you get to a spot and laugh to yourself that if there's no fish in there you might as well pack it up now? It was that king of spot. I toss out my ant pattern from before, right at the bottom of the run before it opens up into a slow slow drift over a hole that was at least three times deeper than any hole I had seen up to that point. I look down to manage my line and prepare for a couple of mends to get that fly to drift perfectly through that hole. When I looked up I saw the silhouette of what would be considered Jaws in this tiny stream. He was nearly at my fly and then he pounded that thing. Not some measly sip. This big boy knew how to eat. I got a great hookset and it was game on. Within the first ten seconds this fish had launched itself two full body-lengths out of the water three times. It was an absolute rocket. It had all the room in the world to swim down because the pool was so deep, and then launch itself straight out of the water like it was straight out of Cape Canaveral. My son had assisted me by pulling the fish out of water, we had both fell back and on the dock.

You know, that moment that you'll be able to look back on and still remember ever little detail, because it just means that much to you? I was lucky enough to be able to experience that with Cash a few months ago. A few girlfriends and I had planned a last minute trip to Clearwater for a girls weekend. Somehow both Lydia's kids and Stacey's kids came down with this god awful stomach bug, so I asked Cash if he wanted to go instead. Spa days aren't exactly a five year old's idea of a grand time, so I knew I had to come up with something that both Cash and I would enjoy. On the flight to Clearwater, we discussed what we wanted to do and decided that fishing would be such an awesome experience for both of us. I grew up fishing, but Cash hadn't gone yet, since his dad wasn't exactly the outdoorsy type.  After a quick Google search and car rental, we were off to the pier to get our fishing permits and gear. When we got to the marina, I paid for the permits and sent Cash to the coolers to look at the bait. I just knew that the live worms and other bait were going to give him quite the shock. The little squeal he let out when he realized the bait was alive gave me a good laugh. After I paid the cashier, I collected our fishing rods and grabbed Cash's hand. It was time to show Cash the joys of fishing. We sat our stuff on the bench near the edge of the dock and I showed him how to bait his hook, and then we did some practice casts. After we both felt confident that he had grasped the concept, I told him to cast off the pier and get ready to do a lot of waiting. I swear, no sooner than his lure hit the water, he had a bite. He squealed with joy as he started reeling in his line. When he finally got the fish on the dock, I helped him remove the hook and toss the fish in the bucket, and repeated the process again. Cash caught a total of twelve fish in the three hours we were there, meanwhile I only caught a measly two. My pride was a little hurt that my five year old just showed me up at fishing, something that I grew up doing, but I could not have been more proud.

Clearwater pier is a huge bridge which used to connect Clearwater to St. Pete but was shut down and later re-purposed into a fishing pier. The morning started out by me teaching him a few safety precautions and showing him how to tie his lines and properly setup his fishing poles. We then began to proceed to fish, the morning started out slow but eventually we began catching fish. The first fish he managed to catch was a small Jack Crevalle. I was so proud of him in this moment no words can describe how it felt watching my son catch his first fish and being able to help him do this.  We kept fishing until lunch time catching a few fish in between. At lunch we prepared a pick-nick with the food supplies we had brought. Once we finished eating lunch we began fishing again catching multiple more fish each until we decided we had fished long enough. We packed up our gear which took around 20-30 minutes and got in the car. After getting in the car we decided to stop on the way home for hamburgers and ice cream. Once we arrived home we cleaned our fishing equipment properly and went inside to shower and relax.",1,"Took my son fishing for the first time in his life.

We thought about possible names. We settled on Dana if it was a girl and Dale if it was a boy. We realized it was quite early on, but the excitement just overtook us. This excitement would soon change to a different feeling. I was at work one afternoon about two weeks after we found out and felt sick. I was very worried, but it passed and I thought nothing of it. About one week later, the unthinkable. I went in for a routine exam with my doctor who gave us the shock of our lives. Our sweet baby's heart had stopped beating. I was devastated and in disbelief.

To my surprise, right when we landed, I noticed that everyone was very nice at us, I was also very impressed because most of the service providers are bilingual, so it was really helpful being able to communicate in our language. When we got to the Hotel, I loved the suite, it was very luxurious , spacious and clean. The view to the ocean was also PERFECT. We really took advantage of the all-inclusive package and I loved the fact that there were at least five different restaurants for all kinds of preferences. (American, Chinese, Mexican, etc). There were also two night clubs inside the Hotel. We loved the private beach (connected to the Hotel) the white sand, and turquoise ocean water, and our unlimited cocktails. We bought tickets to some attractions such as the Chichen Itza (Mayan Ancient City) and the Tour at Xcaret. My family loved the Mayan performance at the end of our Tour at Xcaret. It was a beyond wonderful experience. The Mexican food that we tried was delicious, there were cochinita pibil tacos (seasoned pork) and we just loved the taste. The only thing that we did not like is that we miss one of our booked attractions because we were late for the transportation, other than that it was an unforgettable experience that we can to live again.",1,We decided to go to Cancun Mexico for a week-long vacation and we loved the great experience.

We decided to go to Cancun , Mexico, and it was a fantastic experience. I loved the ocean and the white sand.  My kids had a wonderful time at the beach and I had a great time just relaxing myself sipping on a mango margarita. The most memorable experience is that we went to an event at Xcaret, where we attended to a performance about the Mayan Civilization. Our experience at the hotel was also very pleasurable. We had the all-included service and we loved it. Out hotel had 5 different restaurants ( Mexican, American, Chinese, Gourmet, and one with a mixture of all 5).  The service staff was friendly at all times, and we even received tickets for another attraction.  Our vacation in Cancun was the best we have had so far, and it helped us spend time together as a family. Cancun is just like a paradise, it has everything that we needed to have a great time as a family. When I saw my little twin boys smiling and enjoying the attraction I realized that it was an unforgettable experience for all of us. We have been to other places but for some reason we never truly loved the place, there was always something that didn't worked well, but in this case everything went great. I still believe that Cancun has everything that makes an unforgettable experience. I am planing to go back with my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary (just the two of us) to enjoy a romantic dinner and enjoy the attractions for adults that we did not get to see as a family.",1,We decided to go to Cancun Mexico for a week-long vacation and we loved the great experience.

This made for a much more comfortable stay, as we were able to shower daily vs only when we went into town. We also had more entertainment options available, on the days that weren't quite warm and sunny enough to spend on the water. We did our normal activities up there as well. We visited my wife's family, and had bonfires and smores. We ate at the Tasty Foods, as is tradition. I had fun driving my new truck on the dirt back roads up there, although the truck could use a wash now! It also got a little dinged up, as I backed into a tree with the tailgate down.

My boyfriend's grandmother passed away, and while we weren't technically family, she definitely felt like a family member to me.  She had always been so sweet and welcoming to me and I felt very close to her.  When she had to go into the nursing home after her knee replacement surgery, it wasn't that big of a deal because it was only for rehabilitation, so it wasn't like she was giving up her independence.  She was going to be back in her own home in about 6 weeks.  But she never went home.  During orthopedic rehab she fell and injured her other leg.  Of course everyone in her family was upset and so was I, but we still didn't think that it was a life threatening injury.  Then, after she was transferred back to the hospital, she developed a blood clot in the leg, it shot to her lungs and she was gone overnight.  My reaction was shock, I could hardly believe it could happen like that.  At first my boyfriend and the rest of the family seemed to be reacting the same way, in other words in an appropriate way.  Then after the funeral, things started to change.  People started making comments along the lines of how they felt relieved  that she was gone because they wouldn't have wanted to take care of her if she hadn't recovered well from the fall injury.  More and more family member started to agree with this, even my boyfriend.  They all seemed to be over their grief so quickly.  This response has been so devastating to me.  It's like I can't even turn to these people in my time of grief.  I honestly don't even know if I want to continue in my relationship after this because I can't believe he feels this way.",1,"This story is about boyfriend's grandmother passing away.

They rushed her to the hospital. The doctors said that she shattered the bone in her shoulder. They needed to operate on her. However, they knew that she probably wouldn't survive the surgery due to her fragile condition. They told us that she probably wouldn't live much longer. We should expect the worst. They fed her a steady supply of pain medications while we watched unable to do anything. My boyfriend, his family, and myself returned home to think about what happened. At four in the morning they called us to inform us that her heartbeat was getting fainter. We should return to the hospital if we wanted to say goodbye. So we all left gathering around her. As we said our goodbyes, she passed away. We all stood around crying. My boyfriend's uncle would be arriving shortly to check up on us. We went home afterwards and sat in silence. I found the whole thing depressing. Everyone else seemed to take it better than me. They told me that the person they knew and loved died a long time ago.

It's made me question my perspective on everything from my self concept to my understanding of love and the impermanence of life. Mom had a rare form of cancer that was hard to diagnose and radically aggressive. We only found out about it when she had a body MRI and the tumor was discovered in her kidney. She was given three months to live and a very high certainty of mortality in that time frame, no matter the treatment. Mom's a fighter, so she decided to live those three months as honestly and fully as possible. She moved in with us so she could spend more time with my wife, my daughter and I. It was controversial but she decided against chemo or other treatment so she could enjoy her time. In the first month we traveled to Kauai and Peru, two places she had always wanted to go, but most importantly we walked to daycare to drop off my daughter after laughing through breakfast, watched crappy gameshows and silly movies, and played games. By month two she had lost her ability to really move around, and 60 days later, she passed in her sleep. The honest and tender moments we spent together in her last days have shown me the most important words in life are, ""I love you."" I will never forget the time we spent together. My daughter will always have cherished memories of grandma, her last picture taken was at Pfeiffer park in Big Sur, snuggling with her. Sometimes life puts crises in your path to learn a hard lesson. This lesson for me is about grief. Grief is a hard emotion, but a necessary one. Without grief you cannot know love.",1,"My mother's passing was the most tragic and life-changing event of my life.

Losing her was completely shocking and unexpected. She was young, full of life and had a heart of gold that touched everyone who ever came to know her.  She was my best and confidant and the best grandmother to my young daughter, I could not imagine living the rest of my life without her unconditional love and support. I never liked May, especially because my birthday was in May and the day was always bitter-sweet for me. Although my mother always made it special, I felt sad because I never had any childhood friends to share it with. Now May took on an entirely different meaning, May was the month when my mother left this world forever, I would be left orphaned. I wanted to fill the last days of her life with as much love and peace as possible to repay her back for all the love and  sacrifices that she did for me while I was growing up. I brought my mother home for hospice so I could be with her to the end. I prayed to God as I watched her terrible sufferings, it seemed like she could go at any moment, however, she was trying hard to stay alive until my birthday. It was the most important day of her life and she wanted to be there for me. She lived to see the day, even though she could hardly master any strength, she even signed my birthday card with three simple and yet most powerful words: "" I love you!"". I cried as I help her in my arms. She feel asleep shortly after giving me my card and watching me blow the candles on the cake that my husband brought into her room. She soon slipped into a coma and took her final breath the next morning while I held her hand. I cannot describe the pain of that parting, however, God's strength and my family were the only things that carried me through. At her funeral, my three-year-old daughter came up to me suddenly and said : ""Don't be said Mommy, you have my love forever"".

He was 16 at the start of 2019, he would have been 17 in July 2019. I noticed around February 2019 that he wasn't eating his normal dog food, so I began looking for alternatives so he would be able to eat. I purchased various dog foods, from wet and dry and anything else I could find. Tried different meats like fish, chicken, beef and lamb. He would eat the new dog food that I purchased him for a few days and then all of a sudden stop eating it. It got to the point where I started making his own dog food in a desperate attempt to maintain his weight. But, as much as I tried, he just wouldn't eat as much as he needed to, or wouldn't eat at all. His eyesight was getting worse, to the point where he was almost completely blind. He went deaf when he was 14 years old, so it was breaking my heart watching him lose all of his senses. It was to the point where I was considering putting him down because his quality of life just wasn't there, but then he would have a good day and it would make me question myself. Not only that, I didn't want to put down my baby. He had been my best friend for 16 years and I wasn't ready to let him go. Just writing this now is making me cry. Anyway, he wasn't doing very well but he was still having a few good days here and there, but I noticed around March he was having more bad days at this point. Then, something worse happened.

I knew his time was limited, dogs only live to be around 10-15 years old, but it was still the most difficult day of my life. Weeks prior to losing him, I could tell he was going downhill. He wasn't as excited to eat anymore, he had trouble walking, he completely lost his eyesight. It was hard, watching him go through that. I didn't know if I should be the one to put him down, or hope that maybe he would pass peacefully in his sleep one night. As time went on, I could really see him begin to go downhill. I woke up one morning and found blood in his crate, knowing something was wrong I took him to the vet. They couldn't see any cuts on him, and explained that he may be bleeding from his anus. I asked if maybe he ate something sharp, and they said it was possible but to watch him and see if he continues to do it. So I watched him, and he bled every time he went to go potty. He began to throw up after every time he ate, he didn't know where he was half the time. At one point I picked him up and he bit me, not because I had hurt him, but because he was starting to lose his mind. We knew it was time to put him down, and I hysterics. How could I go to the vets office, and not come back with him? How could I be the one to take my best friend out of this world? How could I stand there for one second and him be there with me, and the next he's gone. The day he bit me was the day I called the vets office and made the appointment, after I hung up I just sat down and cried. That night and the following morning I considered canceling the appointment, but hours before we were supposed to go in it looked like he had a seizure. I held him the entire time to make sure he didn't hurt himself, and once he was done I made him comfortable until it was time. We brought him in, and they drugged him so he was out of it. I didn't leave his side the entire time, I wasn't going to leave him alone. He had been there for me my entire life, so I was going to be there for him. I hugged him one last time while the vet injected him with two different shots, and I saw the light leave his eyes.",4,"A few months ago my dog became more ill, and I knew it was time to put him down.

The bus system is decent but not nearly what I need to work the hours I do. There are nights I'm out of work so late and my only option in getting home is to call a taxi or an Uber which can be costly. I have contacted my ex-husband several times to find out why he missed the payment but have been unsuccessful in reaching him, I feel I may have to contact the court via my lawyer to handle things and this will be costly as well. This situation has caused me great stress. We had an agreement and I don't understand why my ex would want to make things that much more difficult for me. Haven't we argued long enough? Haven't painful words been enough? I am concerned that if this continues, he will forfeit on other court-ordered payments and It would be me in an even worse bind if that's possible. For now, I have been lucky enough to get a ride home from work but this won't last forever. I really hope this can be worked out without having to go to court.

I felt horrible and I felt scared because I was unsure what I was going to do. He had been ordered by the court to make the payments.  We eventually had a contempt hearing where he was ordered to catch up all bills and he would be paying the payment on a new vehicle.  It worked out well for me though because the new car I received was a lower payment.  Eventually I will have to take that payment over and when I do I will be able to afford it.

I knew that having a child was a life changing experience from the start, but I had no clue just how different things would be.  Honestly, I thought that the first couple of months would be a grind trying to develop routines and sleep patterns and just learning how to be a parent, but I thought that I would return to a normal life soon after.  That could not be further from the truth. I hardly ever seen my friends or do personal activities outside of the home anymore.  One reason for this is simple fatigue.  Mariella slept better than most babies for the first five months of her life, but she has regressed significantly and I'm exhausted much of the time.  I also just really value being with her and only get to spend about 90 minutes with her each night before her theoretical bedtime. There is no time to go to happy hour or the movies or dinner with a friend if I want to spend quality time with my daughter on the weeknights.  And my baby girl loves nothing more than being in the same room with her parents, and that's meaningful to me and I want to be there for her. The entire experience of being a father has truly been special.  Every decision I make is viewed through a lens of how it will affect her.  It's fascinating how you can develop such a deep connection with someone you've known for less than a year and who can't even communicate verbally.  It's special because of the changes I'm seeing in her every day like learning how to sit up on her own and because of the changes soon to come.  I'm excited in this very moment thinking about the prospect of her crawling and starting to talk to soon.  She hasn't yet met my immediate family because they live so far away, so meeting them toward the end of 2020 will be a major highlight.",2,"My wife gave birth to our first child, a baby girl, on May 27.

The entire experience was more emotionally moving than I anticipated.  It started with a very long labor for my wife who initially tried to go through labor without relief from drugs, and during this time she needed me more than ever.  I had to be strong, physically and emotionally, to help her cope.  Eventually she took the epidural and the labor became more of a waiting game.  But giving birth is every bit as complicated as it sounds, and we got to the point that it just wasn't progressing even with drugs given to speed up my wife's contractions.  As a result, she had to have a C section, a devastating result for her and I once again had to be stronger than I actually am and do my part to calm her down.  Once that beautiful baby was born, nothing else mattered.  She looked healthy and seemed to instantly bond to us.  I was scared for my wife who just went through a pretty serious surgery and at the same time wanted to give my full self to the little helpless human being.  Having family at the hospital was really a blessing, all so anxious to help and to see our little creation.  It also helped that the doctors and nurses were every bit as smart and helpful as we could have asked for.  The details of that day are permanently engraved in my mind.  The following days, which involved almost no sleep and horrible hospital food, are days that I wouldn't give up for anything.

I couldn't wait to get out there and refresh myself after this past year of working, but when we landed, I couldn't help but shake the news story I read on the flight down. ""Shark mauls Toronto man in Punta Cana"" was the headlines of the ABC News article I read, describing how a man from Toronto got too close to a shark in a scuba diving adventure when the shark lashed at the man. I was planning to go snorkeling for my first scuba experience, and this really threw me off! My wie kept reassuring me that this was a one off chance, but boy was I worked up. I don't often feel scared, but this was something that really threw me for a loop. Fortunately, I was able to come back down to earth and convince myself it would be worth it to go, especially when we talked with some local divers that said that the person was snorkeling in an unsanctioned area known for shark activity and that they had not taken proper safety precautions. I knew that I would always spring for the safer option, and that's what we ended up doing. It ended up being a giant thrill! Seeing the immense array of colorful animals and the diversity below the surface really opens your eyes to how full of life our planet is. I honestly think I could snorkel full-time, it was that exciting! So much so that our planned 1 snorkeling event turned into a 3-day snorkeling tour that we signed up and which blew me away. Sure, relaxing on the beach and spending quality time was fun. But, these unique experiences really showed me what I've been missing. Honest, I can't wait to get back under the water again. Thanks, Punta Cana, I'll see you again soon.",1,"I went to Punta Cana for my 10 year anniversary. I went snorkeling for the first time.

We decided to book a snorkeling excursion, and it was the first time I had ever gone snorkeling. I'm not going to lie, when I first got into the ocean, I started to freak out a little bit.

I was surprised and very happy with the success I had in my new career.,"Two months ago I found myself in the unfortunate situation of being unemployed. I had tried my hand at being a writer, something I always wanted to do, but the sales of my first book were stagnant. I sat at home, wondering how I was going to pay all of my bills, and stared at my useless degree in economics. I never had a passion for economics, and always wanted to do something related to writing. As I contemplated my options, which pretty much amounted to flipping burgers at this point, I got a call from my friend Amy. She mentioned that she had the perfect opportunity for me. Her seventh grade class was doing a lesson on writing, and she wanted me to teach them. I immediately started to freak out. I had no formal training in writing. I mean, it was a passion of mine, but I was mostly self taught. How was I supposed to get a bunch of unruly seventh graders to listen to me? I decided that I wasn't really in a position to act superior to them. I decided to think humble thoughts, and place myself on their level. If I could think of what would interest a seventh grader, I could get through to them. The day of the lesson, I was so nervous. I started to doubt myself. There was no way I would be able to get through to these kids and I was going to fail. Amy talked to me a few minutes before we started, and told me that the students like a certain television show set in the 1980s where the characters have adventures. A light bulb went off in my head. All I had to do was relate the lesson plan to the television show that I also liked, and was very familiar with. The lesson was a great success. Amy even invited me to continue helping her and she thinks I will eventually get a full time job there. I was so delighted, and couldn't believe it.",3,Today I taught Amy's seventh grade class a lesson on writing.

Following my friend Amy's suggestion, I came into her 7th grade class to teach them about writing.  Being a people-pleaser I of course said yes when she asked a few weeks ago despite serious misgivings about my ability to do this.  I was surprised to find that I was not only successful but that I even managed to enjoy myself in front of the class by the end.  Not only that, but my friend Amy was delighted with my performance and would like me to come in again next school year.  Coming in as an authority on any topic is difficult for me because it is so ingrained in my personality to be deferential, even if it's 7th graders.  I risked humiliation in order to stand in front of the class and present what I'd prepared and it was delightful to find that everything you are is not fixed but can change.  It was extremely gratifying to succeed because I put a lot of effort into preparing myself for the task.  I'm hugely relieved that it's over but hopeful about future opportunities.  It's a good reminder to me that challenging myself reaps rewards and that we are all capable of more than just what we have done in the past.  I come away from this experience as less of a defeatist.  I'm more hopeful about the future and what I might do with my time and talent, especially as all of my kids reach school-age in just a few years.  In this moment I'm exhausted from the preparation and execution of this task but I intend to repeat the exercise in the future.  I assumed that my English Literature degree would forever be useless but now I believe there was a good reason for it.  Now it remains to persevere and continue to challenge myself to repeat a nerve-wracking task.  In the future I will at least have the memory that today at least I succeeded, I was surprising and know that not everything about me is fixed.",3,Today I taught Amy's seventh grade class a lesson on writing.

I have been in front of a group of people and I have acted as the resident expert on the subject of writing.  Even though they were seventh graders and willing to accept my authority without question, I know what it has cost me to put myself before them.  It cost me the protection that I have always had from ever letting anyone know how much I knew, or what I was capable of.  I have been insulated by Amy's perceptions of my ability from confronting my actual ability.  At every recurrence of the event in my memory my stomach drops and I choke back the urge to tell someone what an impostor I am.  Amy's words of affirmation soothe this urge but even then I question her sincerity and her likely desire to protect my ego.  Whether Amy is a liar or not, it happened and I think that the main victory lies there.  I have claimed victory over my pride enough to allow myself to stand and be judged.  The fact that I am being praised instead of rejected is a delightful surprise but one that also comes with the responsibility of repetition.  My failure would have at least meant the end of this foray into teaching.  Instead, my success means that I will have to continue to work in humility to teach others what I know and be willing to accept a position of authority.  Nothing is more contrary to my inclinations than to be in charge, to be responsible.  This is a charge I have to accept with humility and possibly even gratitude.  I hope that I will not fail.",3,Today I taught Amy's seventh grade class a lesson on writing.  This required an enormous amount of humility for me to do and I was determined that I would fail.

We had been dealing with financial difficulties in our previous house. We were always pretty poor; I had a low paying job and she was unemployed, but it wasn't a problem before. The biggest issue was that we always had roommates before, but then they moved out. We could have potentially gotten replacements, but the house was so old and run down that nobody seemed very interested. The landlord wasn't very responsive and to make things worse, some squatters had been nextdoor for several months already. At a certain point, I no longer had enough money for rent payments. It was a very stressful time in both of our lives. Through some stroke of luck, one of the members of my girlfriend's church was looking for new roommates; someone that was friendly and we could trust. Thankfully, they trusted us as well, since we still didn't have the income to pay rent, but were looking for work. We started packing and got ready to leave that old house behind. I still hurt when I think about that old place; we had a big back yard with a beautiful garden and it was fairly peaceful until the squatters were there, but those times are lost to the past now. It took nearly a month to get everything out of there; we had made our lives there together for about 3 years and I had lived there for 6 years before; most of my adult life. Thankfully we were able to get help moving boxes. I don't know how we managed to get everything stored away here, but somehow my girlfriend found a way. She can do anything when she puts her mind to it. We've been here for 3 months now and it's starting to feel like home, but there's still things to get used to. We live with 2 other people and have to share a bathroom, which is pretty annoying, but I guess it's okay. It almost feels like I'm going through a haze, still, but we keep on going.

He died from cancer. I don't think he was sick for long. The most memorable thing was getting to meet family members that I had never met before because my grandfather had had a fallen out with them. Oh and the firing of the guns at the funeral was also memorable. That had probably been the most time I had spent with that side of the family since I don't get to see them often. One of my cousins lead the sermon at the funeral since he preaches at his own church. Our family isn't big so it was pretty intimate. There were some funny and nice stories about him in his youth. Also go to reunite with some siblings I don't see often. Found out some more information about the family since my brother is interested in family research. Talked about everyone's careers.

I've lived here 16 years, not the longest by far in this little area, but established. I own my home. I have planted many flowers, repainted it myself and reroofed a formerly run-down rental. The new neighbors put up a religious sign, from the local hate church. You know, the kind of church that goes to gay pride with signs that say, 'god hates fags,' or picket planned parenthood with fetus photos and angry shouting. The new neighbors' son also practice with weapons on the lawn with his buddies, some kind of asian battle sticks, numchucks, that kind of thing. It's a bunch of white men in their early 20's dressed in black almost every evening, using weapons. I am lesbian and not the only gay on the street. I felt more than a little threatened. Some neighbors stopped by to check in with me and let me know I could come by if I felt unsafe.  Two houses left phone numbers. After the new folks put up their sign from the hate church, new signs started popping up all over the neighborhood. It is a sign based on a US flag with lines of colored print. One line says, 'all are welcome here.' Another line says, ""diversity makes us strong. ' Another says, 'black lives matter.' Basically liberal, loving and inclusive statements and rally cries as befits most residents in this liberal university town. I felt very supported,  as an individual,  as a member of the neighborhood and as a member of a group often targeted for the way we were born.  When the church sign went up, I wasn't sure my neighbors would know the type of church it is- a divisive church, a judgemental church. But they did know, and responded. Now the new neighbors have taken down their sign. But the diversity signs have remained and multiplied.

At this point, he got arrested again eight days later for dealing drugs in another county. They also released him on bond. Then ten days after that, he was pulled over and arrested again for driving on a suspended license and drug trafficking again. At this point, he is denied bond, so I can not get my money or any child support from him.  He can't seem to pay me, but the payments on his new car are still being made. In addition to this, he has managed to pay for a personal attorney in all of his cases. He has also paid for a different lawyer to try to get him bond, but if he gets bond, I know he will not end up paying me.

He has been abusive over the last few years and left myself and the children with nothing. I was pinning kitchen towels on my son because we had no diapers. He had been ordered to do things over and over as our marriage went on and decided not to abide by any of the agreements we made that were turned into court orders, but no one ever did anything about those things. I finally was able to take him to court and get justice for myself and my children. We went to court last month on a Rule to Show Cause for why he had not done the things that were in the agreement. He got a lawyer, but I could not afford one, as it took me 10 months to save up the money for filing for the hearing in the first place. When we started testifying, his lawyer kept breaking in to say that the things that I was trying to tell her were irrelevant, but I needed to get the information out there to prove why they were relevant. He also lied to the court regarding what I was testifying about and had lied in many cases in the past and always won based on those lies. In one case, he lied in a child support case to the extent to where the judge wouldn't listen to anything I said and even went so far as to deny me child support in the case, leaving the kids and I with nothing at all from him but what we were able to talk him out of at holidays, which typically was not much. But for some reason, this judge was different. She actually listened to me and let me present my evidence and connect the dots in the case. I didn't have an attorney, so I wasn't really sure what I was doing and I was scared that he would be laughing at me on the way out the door again, as he always did when they won. But she was patient with me and gave me a chance to locate the information that she needed in order to decide what she was going to do about is. There was one part of the case that he should have been responsible for paying for that she dismissed, because of an error at the courthouse that caused his attorney to not have all of the documentation that she needed, but the judge said that she would allow me to bring that case back with the proper paperwork, so that they could fix the error and she would decide on that separately. When it was over, she ordered him to comply with the order and pay me everything that he owed me within 45 days or go to jail.

With the support of family and close friends, they helped out tremendously. I was able to get back to school to finish out my spring semester with great grades. The lessons learned is saving money and looking into fares ahead of time as they are cheaper. People will pay a premium for train tickets if they purchase them late. Another lesson learned is to always have a strong support system. In addition to having a strong support system, it reminds me to never forget those whom helped me. Paying it forward is an important part of my journey in life. Keeping in mind a philosophy of interdependence, we all owe one another. I do my very best to dedicate my time and efforts to helping others. One day those same people you have helped will be in a position to help you.

It is one of my most favorite times of the year as it is a great time where I can bond with my family. The problem is that because of the poor weather around our area, sometimes it's hard to figure out a date where everyone in my family can get together and have a fun day at the ponds. My Aunt usually checks the weather one week ahead so I got the invitation only last week. It didn't bother me at all though because I would clear my weekend schedule for this, it's one of my favorite things that we do each year. I also love the fact that my Aunt caters the derby with Cracker Barrel as it is one of my favorite restaurants. She also has a few carnival games set up and we do some field day type games like the egg toss and a potato sack race. It's basically a really fun time where our family can just forget about all of our problems. There are prizes for the top 3 biggest fish that are caught. I actually got 2nd place this year which is my best finish ever and I got a $50 Gift Card to Amazon! My cousin ended up finishing first and he caught a bass that weighed 7 pounds. Sadly, my fish was only 6.4 pounds so I was close but I'll try better next year. First prize was a $100 Gift Card to Amazon. It wasn't about the prize for me though, the experience is worth way more than the gift cards anyway. I love getting to spend time with my family and this event is the most fun we have all year long.

There was a lot of food at the fishing derby, hot dogs, burgers, macaroni salads, and much more, and I loved eating all of it. I might have even eaten too much during the event because I got a stomachache afterwards. But then I had to make room for dessert and I just couldn't resist the temptation of some amazing cake, even though I regretted the overfull feeling I felt later, if only a bit. Lots of my family members whom I don't get to see very often were there at the derby and I got to talk to them. I talked to my aunts and uncles and cousins and their kids, and it was nice being able to catch up with them. Some of my nieces and nephews had grown up a lot since the last time I had seen them, some were entering high school and others weren't little infants anymore, and were toddling and running about everywhere around the stock pond. There was a fishing contest for all the kids, which is why the event was called a fishing derby, where they all would fish and catch frogs from my aunt's stock pond. I didn't participate in the derby games because I'm a bit too old to do that anymore. Perhaps maybe my lack of participation in the contests might have just been because I don't really like how slimy fish and frogs feel in my hands. The kids all had some other contests for them to compete in as well, and I watched from the sidelines with the adults. During the frog race, the kids all picked one caught frog, and had to coax them to hop across a finish line the fastest. But a surprising thing happened during the frog race, one of the kids accidentally coaxed their frog to jump onto me and I might have panicked reflexively. But on the other hand I ended up kicking out my foot and flinging the frog over the finish line, making my little cousin the winner of that round. It was a fun event, with lots of laughs and a bunch of good memories for me.",5,"I went to a family gathering event on a Sunday morning.

It was a potluck type event, but there was plenty of good food to be had like hotdogs, burgers, and macaroni salad. I ate a lot more than I anticipated and gave myself a bit of a stomachache but I still don't regret it either because I enjoyed it all. Along with the fishing contest there were other activities like frog catching with nets, with prizes for catching the biggest frog or fish. After that was the annual picture with all the kids and young adults who hadn't reached thirty yet, I was in that photo too. Then after we did that we watched the littler kids all participate in the frog race, where on a sheet they would race the captured frogs to win other prizes. I didn't participate in the games because I had already outgrown the age range of the kids participating. It was fun just watching the kids and teens have fun though, and I got to eat more while I watched. I indulged myself in dessert and talking to some of the family members I didn't usually get many chances to see casually. Also I nearly had a frog jump on me during the frog race for the kids. While I like frogs, I don't like slimy feels so I jumped back a bit when the kids were releasing all the caught frogs back into the pond. At the end of the event we all got commemorative coins for the event that my aunt had specially prepared for the occasion and I was happy to get one. Before I left the event to go home, I picked some wild apples from an apple tree near the road entrance on my aunt's property with my mom, who'd attended the event with me.

I am having a difficult time writing this because I felt as if Dad and I were starting to get close again after such a long time apart.  Until Dad's cancer, I hadn't seen or talked to him in over 10 years.  The bitterness that I held inside was very taxing on me and I'm sure on him as well.  When he left Mom for another woman, he destroyed our lives.  As a little girl, I always looked to Dad as my hero.  I truly looked up to him and thought of him as the greatest man on earth.  I always felt that if I ever got married, I wanted my husband to have the same characteristics as Dad.  After Dad left, I began a downward spiral and didn't want anything to do with any man.  Through prayer and guidance, I have been able to get past these feelings and realize that I can't put every man in the same category.  After Dad was diagnosed with Cancer, he asked to see me and we talked many times and began to heal our relationship.  Dad regretted the horrible mistakes he made and asked forgiveness from God, Mom and me.    Just saying ""I forgive you"" began the healing process for both of us.  Sadly, it wasn't long after that the Lord decided to take Dad.

It has the most beautiful stores, mall, eateries one can visit. Denver also have different varieties of food one will want to taste. I and my boyfriend also tasted all the delicacy there.

This was the third time in three years that we've made this trip. We go there to watch hockey games, to hang out with our friends that have moved there, and to drink craft beer, as this is a hobby of ours. I am the planner, and am comfortable planning things for us because my boyfriend doesn't care about what we do one way or another. This year I let him know I was planning for us to visit a total 19 different breweries and worked out when could do each thing I wanted. One of the things we had to figure out when we would be hitting up all the breweries I wanted to visit in Boulder. We had to plan this carefully because some days were just out of the question - there were two days we needed to be in Denver for because we would be attending hockey games, and we wanted to be in Denver on the last day we were leaving instead of going to the airport from Boulder. In the end, everything worked out. We went to Boulder the day we got into town. We got to see his friend that moved up there. I got to spend some one-on-one time at brunch with my friend while my boyfriend slept in at the hotel. We got to see hockey games. We visited a cat cafe on our final day in town and brought them some toys that I had ordered and shipped to an Amazon Locker. My boyfriend got some advice from brewers, as he was seeking to brew his own beer. We even got to visit some places that weren't on the list because I didn't schedule any restaurants for us to visit while we were there. Every day was rewarding because we had an itinerary, a purpose for visiting each brewery, and because I focused on location and hours of operation of each of those places and planned accordingly. The only thing we didn't get to do - again - was visit the Denver Mint. He had been wanting to go since the first year we went. Maybe next year.",1,"My boyfriend and I made our third trip to Denver.

I was driving down the road and I remember just being very sleepy and I was having a hard time staying awake. The next thing I knew I was looking down at a pool of blood that had apparently come from my head. I had been in an accident with another vehicle. I had blacked out and ran head on into this other person. I was taken to the hospital by helicopter because this was an emergency situation. I spent months in the hospital because of this accident and I had to go through rehabilitation to walk right again. While I was in the hospital I was asked many questions and many tests were done to me. After having gone through all of this I was diagnosed with Sleep Apnea. Sleep Apnea serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts. This causes you to not get good sleep. This may have also caused the accident. I didn't know my sleep was not going well and since I was sleepy I blacked out while sleeping and caused the accident. Having done this to myself and another person has made me feel awful. If I had just looked into this sooner perhaps this may have never happened. I promise that from now on I will take my health more seriously.

I rode my bike to the bank in order to deposit a check. That in itself went smoothly. While cycling back home to the bank, however, my route so happened to weave through a path where rowdy kids were playing. I did not plan ahead and did not think of an alternative route to cycle through, so I had no choice but to go past them. They partook in a match of paintball. As they were playing, I got hit in the shoulder by one of the paintball capsules. I was super mad at the children, and was tempted to yell at them. I just wanted to get home above all, though, so instead of adding to the conflict I instead made sure to bike much faster until I knew for sure I was completely out of the kids sights. During the rest of my ride, my mind had two focuses. One was getting home, the other was how annoyed I was at it happening to me. I showered just before going to the bank, and now I'll have to shower again! But it could've been worse. At the very least, I wasn't hurt that badly.

I did that, and was cycling home, when suddenly I heard a weird noise, and noticed some pain in my back. I didn't realize what was going on, and just then I saw a car driving next to me, and some ugly dark-skinned subhuman face looking at me. It was then that I realized that I had been shot, with something, and saw that this hideous mongrel chick was trying to shoot me again. I yelled at her, and reached for my own gun, and the cowardly spawn of liberals drove off because they don't fight with people who are able to defend themselves. They got away before I could defend myself. I then went to the liquor store for beer, and was able to verify that it was a paintball gun I'd been shot with. My backpack and clothes were covered with the junk. My back hurt pretty good, and when I left the liquor store I cycled around for a bit to see if I might run into those beautiful brown skinned children of Obama again, but there was no such luck. I went back to my place, and looked in the mirror, and there was a nice golf-ball sized dent in my back where I'd been hit, surrounded by a big red welt. Liberal social justice had been served tonight. Cheered up by this realization, I had my beers and iced up my back, and tried to get over the whole thing, realizing it was inevitable as part of the progress that modern society needs to march forward bravely into the beautiful new era of liberalism.  Despite this, I resolved to be more ready to get my gun out in the future. I also decided to save up money for a longer range firearm in case preventive measures become necessary at some later date. Then I went to bed.",5,"Kids shot me with a paintball gun while I was cycling back from the bank.

I was on the way back, and I noticed a car driving slowly next to me, and I heard a couple of sharp cracks, and I was startled, I thought maybe a tree had fallen or something. Very quickly I noticed a sharp pain in my back, and while this was going on,  I noticed one of the people in the car was leaning out the window staring at me. I saw her ugly brown face staring at me, and saw she was holding something. As it turned out, it was a paintball gun, and was still shooting at me. This 'disadvantaged' ethnic minority type had just injured me, but not badly enough, she wanted to shoot me in the face or something, so maybe I'd fall off my bike and get hurt real bad, as some form of liberal social justice. Well, I stopped my bike, and reached into my fanny pack to my own gun, a real one, and they quickly sped up their car and drove away. I considered taking a shot at them, but I realized it was unlikely I'd hit them, and so I decided against it. I was in a decent amount of pain by this point, but I decided to take a detour to the liquor store instead of going straight home, picked up a 6 pack of beer, and had the people at the store tell me how much paint and crap were on my shirt, and backpack.  As it turned out, my backpack had absorbed most of the shots, so it was the article of clothing that was most paint-soaked. I got my beer, and painfully cycled home. When I arrived I took off my backpack, and shirt, and observed the injury in the mirror, it was like there was a golf ball sized dent in one of the large muscles of my back, and a nice fist sized red mark surrounding it. I put some ice on the injury, drank my beer, and tried to sleep, though it really hurt. Since then, I've been more cautious about passing cars, and bystanders in general, and I've practiced getting out my gun more quickly in case something like this happens again. I've also thought about it a lot, if someone assaults me in a similar way in the future, am I prepared to respond to them with lethal force? The answer to that is yes, I only suffered a minor injury but if things had happened a bit differently I could have been hurt very badly, and it's only right, that surrounded by people who will hurt me badly for no reason at all, other than some vague ethnic/identity/liberal ideology, I have to be prepared to hurt them first, to protect myself, at all times.",5,"Kids shot me with a paintball gun while I was cycling back from the bank.

Tells it like it is and lives his own truth."" The guitar had a bright red guitar logo on it. I felt that this meant a lot to me since I love rock and playing guitar. My mother put a lot of thought into this card and knew exactly what I wanted. It made me feel very motivated. I felt very appreciative of this card, following that she took me to the movies to go see Godzilla. I felt very appreciative of this, because Godzilla is one of my favorite franchises. She even bought me popcorn. Though, initially the popcorn was stale a fact I bought up to her she suggested that I go and get another bowl. I went to get a fresh bowl of popcorn made and it was delicious. It was warm and buttery. After we finished watching the movie I thought that it was alright and decent. My mother liked it a little more than I did surprisingly. I felt that there was a bit little too much focus on human characters that weren't necessarily all that interesting in my opinion. The final fight was alright, but it needed a bit more focus on the monsters, there isn't much human characters can do and also a lot of the humor was awkward and fell flat. A lot of the characters in the movie felt pointless and unnecessary. Following that she took me to go and get some Indian food. I really appreciated that, because Indian cuisine is my favorite. The food that day was particularly delicious. I had a short conversation with some people next to me, but I don't really think my intrusion into their conversation was all that welcomed. It was a fun day all and all and I had a lot of appreciation for my mother and her taking me to the movies.",5,"Basically, I spent my birthday with my mother.

She lost her battle with cancer earlier this year. I wrote this in her memory.,"2 weeks ago, I woke up more excited than ever because it was finally the day that I was going to be able to see my best friend Hollie for the first time in over a YEAR! She'd  been away working in another country and she just moved back to our city earlier this month. The first thing I did that morning was text her and see where she wanted to go. She recommended the local cafe that we used to go to for lunch all of the time before she left. Best of all? This was going to be a girl's day, just the two of us, NO BOYFRIEND ALLOWED. I drove to meet her at 12:30 p.m. and we met in the parking lot at about 12:45. When I saw her, I almost started to cry and I think she did, too. She was my best friend, my person, my soul sister, and we were finally reunited after what felt like 10 years. We hugged each other in the parking lot and neither of us wanted to let go... until we realized just how hungry we were. Letting each other go, we were already starting to catch up on things when we entered the restaurant, and we even got our favorite table: the one right next to the window. It finally felt like everything was falling back together again! I asked her about her time away and she spent time asking me about Cory (my boyfriend) and I, and if we had finally tied the knot yet. I told her we were thinking about it, and as soon as he popped the question, she would be my maid of honor for sure. I told her I couldn't imagine a wedding without her in it, and then she started to get quiet. She was tearing up, and I didn't know why. I thought I said something to offend her? Maybe she was upset that I brought Cory into the conversation? I asked her what was wrong after a few minutes of silence and I already knew something major had happened before she spoke... and then she told me the truth. The reason she had moved back home is because she was diagnosed with colon cancer. She wanted to begin her treatments at home, surrounded by her close friends and family, because she didn't know how effective they would be. The cancer had already progressed before it was diagnosed. I wanted to cry, too, but I didn't want to make her upset. I promised her that day that I would fight with her every step of the way, and no matter what happened, she wouldn't be alone.",5,I got to see my best friend after not having seen her in over a year.
