Yikes. I still cringe to this day thinking about what happened three months ago. So Lynn, Eric and I were on the last leg of our road trip. We were heading to Acadia National Park. We were having a good time talking about what podcasts we were listening to lately. I mentioned that I started listening to a new true crime podcast. It piqued Eric's interest, so of course he turned around from the front passenger seat trying to get to his phone to pull up the podcast. Lynn was driving and was taken aback by a grown man trying to get to his bag like he was still a kid. It all happened so quickly. I tried to tell Eric that I would grab his phone, and to sit back down. But no he 's up already, and almost had it. That's when Lynn decided to pinch him on the rear end. All hell broke loose. Eric didn't expect it and rolled on his side. Too bad it was the driver's side. Lynn lost control of the car for a moment and we began to swerve towards the trees. Then she regained control. For that moment, all I could think about us crashing into the trees and my parents. Lynn pulled over to steady her nerves and to see if we were okay. We were fine physically but had the one of the biggest scares in our life. Moments later a police car pulled up to check if we were okay.

It was during the summer, and all of our bags were packed. My friends and I were ready to go to our trip to Acadia National Park.  We were extremely excited for this because we planned this all year long, and it was finally time to embark on our journey together. It was about a 5 hour drive, and it took a long time, but during this drive, it was extremely eventful. In fact, what happened that day could have been one of the scariest things that happened to us. While listening to some music, my friend was driving the car and singing along, and stopped paying full attention to the road. Suddenly, I could feel him drifting left to right and not have full control of the car. This scared me instantly, and I shut down the music being in the passenger seat, and told him to focus on the road. But there was a cop behind us looking at what we were doing, and he pulled us to the side just to ask to make sure if we were drunk or not. Just experiencing that part really scared us because we knew we all weren't drunk, but the feeling of being pulled aside is a scary moment. We continued with our journey, and the entire trip was great. However, just that moment was the one thing that resided within our minds throughout the entire trip. Going through this experience, I learned to always keep our eyes on the road.

My girlfriend, and I went to the Columbus Zoo about a month ago. It happened to be one of the hottest days recorded in July in the city! We had been planning this trip for weeks, so despite the weather, we decided to stick to our plans. Ashley and I have been working on spending more time together as we both work full-time jobs that prevent us from having date nights. More recently, I have been asked to work overtime on weekends, but this weekend I knew it would be more beneficial to spend time with her. We got to the zoo early before many of the large groups came and grabbed a snack from the snack bar so we could get a head start on seeing our favorite animals. Ashley really enjoyed seeing the elephants and giraffes, while I wanted to see the tigers and lions. The giraffes were running around playing with their young babies who looked as if they had just learned to walk. We were really lucky to see the penguins who were out swimming in the afternoon, but not for very long. It looked like they had gotten full from all of the fish they were being fed and went back into their private area to nap. I couldn't blame them for that! It felt like a much needed day together with my girlfriend. It meant a lot to me personally, as I have been stressed at work and Ashley finds a way to get me talk about some of the things I've been holding in. It was truly a wonderful experience. What was really neat is that the zoo offered free lemonade to their guests once the temperature got above 95 degrees. Ashley must have had a gallon of lemonade that day! I think Ashley had a great time also, as she talked about the animals on the entire drive back home.",1,"Me and my girlfriend went to the zoo on a hot day.

Then we walked in the African animals section. We saw elephants mostly and we could hear monkeys and apes in the distance somewhere. So we keep walking and eventually we find the apes. We saw gorillas hanging out in the shade and in a different section we saw other chimps and monkeys. We walked past that and we saw giraffes. Watching the giraffes was a cool site because they got really close to us. Like one of them was looking at me and came in my direction and I thought it would actually do something to me. Then after we saw the lions and they were mostly hanging out in the shade to stay out of the heat. We continued to walk around and we saw a section with Australian animals. So we managed to see koalas in the tress and tasmanian devils. I think we also saw kangaroos but I can't remember. We spent a lot of time at the zoo maybe around 5-6 hours.

Every few years at least. I was in a small tourist town in Thailand right by Pattaya Beach. I was out fairly late one evening and decided to just roam around the city and take some pictures of the citizens there, the shops, nightclubs etc. I found myself in a rather secluded and dingy part of the city and wasn't sure exactly how to get back to my hotel. I was looking for one of the motorbike taxis but didn't see any. While I was looking around there was a group of Thais, probably in her early 20s and I could tell that they were part of a gang or something like that. I thought for sure I was going to get robbed or beat up or both. They were just across the small street giving me the eye and all of a sudden a taxi went by and I waved at him frantically. He saw me and drove over to where I was at and pick me up. I got back to my hotel safely but I was pretty shaken because I knew things were going to go badly if that small gang caught up with me. I was in that city for another two weeks and I still ventured out and about but I tried to be a lot more careful about what parts I ventured into. I really should have known better as I have been to quite a few other countries and have been in cities that were not very safe.

It was a lovely wedding– very unlike any wedding I’ve yet been to, but a lot like the weddings in the movies (you know, like The Wedding Crashers… never understood why someone would *want* to go to a wedding they weren’t invited to).  The ceremony was short and simple, though there were a lot of attendants, complete with flower girl and ring-bearer.  The bride had both her father and step-father give her away, one on each arm.  The Lutheran minister was kind of a jolly middle-aged woman.  The gentlemen were almost all in army dress uniforms.  From my cousin’s face, you could not tell he was hit by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan just a few months ago.  He’s still not walking correctly and never may, but the damage seems to mainly be concentrated in one leg. The wedding was in a part of the country where folks are not as stiff as Midwesterners or as unstructured as Northern Californians.  I’ve been to Midwestern wedding receptions that tried to be like this reception, but the soul wasn’t there so they always ended up being kind of lame with folks congregated in the parking lot to talk away from the DJ.  People at this wedding line-danced (and not just to country music) and they enjoyed it.  My usually introverted uncle is apparently a dancing fiend and led the bride in some traditional dances.  This essay is plagiarized.  The food was great and full of local specialties (including something we heard about on the Splendid table from their road trip foodies).  And, important in my book for any wedding, they served appetizers between the wedding and reception. You may recall that the groom’s parents had said they refused to attend because he was not getting married by a priest.  Not only did they not show up, despite his being hit by a roadside bomb in service to our country, they did not allow any siblings to come.  The daughter whose college my parents and aunts are paying was threatened with being disowned when her mother found out she was planning to attend.  So she didn’t go.  Guests kept asking if I was a sister.  No, not a sister.",4,My life was endangered for doing research on people. I suffered a lot because of this.

I then notice I was being followed by people I did not know. They followed me to my house and if I went to the store they where there. I said to myself aint this some shit. so I started to record myself with people. The idea was very good because if I end up on a killing spree people would know the truth about what is happening.

I will forever remember it as something sticking and in all honesty, the day I became an adult. Not that I wasn't one already. On that day, I remember I did everything as I would each day prior to work. I ate breakfast, drank my regular cup of coffee with cinnamon sprinkled on top, etc. However, on my way home, I began thinking about an argument I had with my mom a few days prior. I was thinking about how it made me feel and the events that led up to the event. As I parked, I saw that no one was home except my mom. I went ahead and entered my house, and went to grab a snack. As I closed the refrigerator, I saw my mom standing in the hallway. I approached her to speak about the events from the other day. We went back and forth in a very emotional conversation. This was probably one of the most intense conversation I have ever had with my mom. She told me so many things that it made me think twice about how I was behaving towards her. It was the day that I found out my mom did not know how to swim. I HAD NO IDEA. I was honestly so shocked and surprised that I had seen my mom in pools before, but never knew she couldn't swim. How can I not know something so important about my mom?Which made me realize that I only have one mother. I should be paying more attention to her. I should be bonding with her more. Because one day, she will not be there. After the compelling conversation, we then proceeded to plan a mother/daughter day. We planned to eat tacos that weekend and watch a movie together, which we did. It was honestly of the best weekends ever.

Feeling we had nothing to hide, we simply acquiesced. He began just rummaging through the glovebox, and we knew we were fine. Nothing to find, here.

I thought, no problem, and told him it would be ok since I was off that day. I told him just to gas up and get it back safely after his shift. Little did I know that he had other plans in store that involved the law and I was being taken for a ride so to speak. This is the story of how my good friend got arrested and it led to the end of our friendship. After my friend took the car, I got a call from the police about an hour later saying that he was now in prison and I had the option of bailing him out. I did end up bailing him out, but thought - what in the world is going on? It turns out he had been tipped off that something was going on at his work and so when he took my car - thinking they would not recognize him in it - he was still arrested at his job place (during his shift) for embezzlement. His plan had not worked and in the process, I also could not pick up my car right away. Turns out it had to be impounded and I had to pay an additional 80. 00 dollars to get it out of the lot since I was not present at the time of this activity. This whole situation affected our relationship in a number of ways. We are still friends and ok generally, but not as close now. It broke my trust with my friend and made me look around at all things in my life. And secondly, it showed me that people you know, even, will do anything when they are desperate. He had been having money trouble and thought he could get away with this. It turns out cameras at his job place knew different and that is how he was eventually caught.

When I got there the lawyer had already arrived and was talking to the police. He told me that he had been arrested for possession of illegal drugs and needed 50000 cash bail. He told of how the policemen came knocking on his door one Saturday morning. He was just busy having his breakfast without a worry in the world. The police demanded they search the house. He questioned them on why or what they were looking for and they said drugs. They already had a search warrant so they just went in the house and started searching. When they found the drugs they arrested him and took him to the station. He did not know where the drugs had come from. He wondered who might have told on him.,2,There was an arrest.

It was not something that needed urgent attention, but the doctors told us that he would probably need to have it surgically removed at some time in his life. Sometimes extra digits are just flesh, but my son's was well-developed with bone, blood vessels, and tendons. As a baby, the extra toe did not hinder his development at all. He started walking around 12 months old, the typical age. However, shoes were hard to find to accommodate his much wider than average foot. We spoke with a specialist when he was two years old, but she wanted to wait at least a year for the surgery because the risks from anesthesia lessen in slightly older children. We returned to the specialist just after he turned four. Given that the surgery wasn't an emergency, we had to wait a few months for an appointment time to be available. On the day of the surgery my son was calm and happy. Being so young, he wasn't really aware what was about to happen. The surgery was also taking place in a children's hospital, so they had a lot of toys and other accommodations to make him feel comfortable. The surgery went quickly and smoothly, but waking up was difficult for my son. He was in a lot of pain and required three shots of morphine into his IV before he felt better. However, after that initial discomfort, the rest of the recovery went really well. He never needed pain medicine and was up waking around with his cast by that evening. After two weeks, he was able to have his cast removed. His foot was tender and sensitive without the support and protection of the cast, but after about three days he was able to walk normally again. Now the only thing that remains from the surgery is a light scar on the side of his foot.",1,My four year old son needed foot surgery.

He was born with a condition called polydactylism, which means having extra fingers or toes. In my son's case, he was born with an extra pinky toe on his left foot. As a baby it was easier to manage, since babies obviously don't need shoes, but now as a preschooler his extra little toe would often hurt him while wearing tennis shoes. My husband and I always knew that he would need this surgery, but we were still worried when the day actually arrived. Neither he nor I, nor our older son, had ever needed surgery before. This was uncharted waters for us. When we arrived at the hospital Thursday morning, the nurses took his vitals to make sure he was healthy enough for surgery that day. Other than that, a lot of the time was just spent waiting. It made my husband and I feel sad because our son was hungry but he was not allowed to eat prior to the surgery. Thankfully the hospital did have a good amount of toys that helped keep him distracted. Finally around 12:30 in the afternoon he was taken back for his surgery. My husband and I were not allowed to go back with him, but the nurses and doctors made it fun for him by taking him back in a big push car. Once they got to the room, they put a small mask on his face with the strawberry scented gas he had picked out earlier. After he was asleep with the gas, they put the needle in his hand for the other anesthesia. Surgery only lasted about one hour. The nurse came to get my husband and I to take us to where our son was recovering. He's normally a really happy little guy, but unfortunately he was in a lot of pain and very confused coming out of his surgery. He ended up needing three shots of morphine in his IV to manage the discomfort. Thankfully it seemed to work quickly and soon we were on our way home.

When we were kids we fought a lot. She liked chocolate I liked strawberry, ice cream. I liked rock music, she liked jazz. We would argue a lot. We had different friend groups. That was that. This was about 10 years ago. We were both musicians growing up. I played rock music in a band and she was always practicing classical violin. We never paid much attention to each other due to this difference in stylistic taste. When she went to music school 2 months ago I knew she would broaden her musical tastes, and I supported her work. I was extremely surprised last week at her concert. Her jazz band played music that was very angular and dynamic the way that certain rock music is. I asked her about this. She said that she ended up with some members in her band that had rock music tastes like me. She was able to see that as something they had in common to make music about.

I would theorize it could have been mostly due to competition for the affection of our parents. I was the second child...she was the first. She was the one with stellar grades all throughout her education, from kindergarten all the way through her prestigious university years. She is now a professional musician in an orchestra as well as a music teacher. Growing up I tended to be a rather mediocre student. I am confident that I am intelligent, I just never have had the drive to excel. Perhaps because I knew devoting a great deal of energy to ""competing"" with my sister would not only be futile, but absolutely exhausting. I have always been one to get lost in my thoughts and I prefer to be in nature to feel truly alive. That is why it was so memorable that a few months ago my mother told me that recently my sister told her that she only knows particular symphonies because she would hear me playing them in my room, next door to hers. I did not even know she was listening to the music I was playing, I always pictured her diligently reading and/or practicing the various instruments with which she is now proficient. After hearing that from my mother I actually felt a rush of pride. Not only was I absorbing and getting lost in the extraordinary music, but I was also influencing my orchestral musician sister. To add to that, the other day, she called me up about a certain composer because, as she put it, I am a ""musicologist of sorts."" (In  addition to listening to music, I would study biographical information about the various composers to whom I listened. Back in my childhood days, I never would have dreamed that I would be having an unintended influence on my rather brilliant sister.

Two baby girls! After a few worrisome doctor visits, we found out one baby was absorbed by the other. While we were very saddened by the loss of one baby, we were ecstatic about the healthy baby girl my wife was carrying. While my wife was nesting in preparation for parenthood, I was reading every baby book I could find! By the time the baby, Ella, was born, we felt we were prepared but we couldn't have been more wrong. No amount of reading can prepare you for the immediate and immense love you feel when you first hold your child. I knew from the moment I looked at those warm brown eyes that I would lay down my life for this child. There is no greater joy than seeing something so perfect and knowing that you are the reason it exists. The first month was the hardest. Adjusting to a new baby in the house, and her sleep/wake schedule while maintaining our own routines was very taxing on our relationship. I'll admit, I could have tried harder. Unfortunately, that's the thing about hindsight, only it is 20/20. While we both love our child very much, and I will always cherish the good times, and bad throughout my wife's pregnancy; we couldn't make our marriage work.

I had to defend my purchase, so I just ignored her and kept shopping. Later on, I left my cart alone and noticed that the woman took my griddle out of my shopping cart, which pretty infuriating. I secretly ""stole"" it back into my cart without her noticing and watched her checkout without realizing it was gone. I felt bad but at the same time I found the griddle first. I wish that I could have seen her realize that she didn't have the griddle in the parking lot but I didn't get the chance to see this woman again.

I normally have no problem with this but i neglected  to turn on the lights in the hallway and I was unable to see where I was going.  I have glaucoma, so it is very hard for me to see in low light conditions.

Also, I suffered a subdural hemotoma that caused bleeding on my brain.  They were obviously more worried about my brain injury.  I received a half dozen MRI's of my head.  As far as the broken bones, they just gave me a splint and told me that the collarbone and ribs would heal over time.

I can't believe it!  I CAN SPEAK SPANISH!  After the encounter I had a few months ago with that family in the car wreck, I am so glad that that language barrier is gone.  I really felt so hopeless when I was trying to talk with that Spanish speaking family to ensure everyone was ok and reassure them that help was on the way.  Of course I would be the first person on the scene and probably the one person in the area that did not know any Spanish!  I was relieved that the police and fire department showed up so quick.  I was so desperate for help and unable to effectively communicate with the family inside the car still that I literally felt sick.  I am so glad my friend told me about the duo lingo app shortly after the incident.  I downloaded the app almost immediately and was very surprised at how easy it was to start learning another language.  It did not take long before I had a basic understanding of the language.  Shortly after that I could follow along in a conversation and eventually I felt comfortable enough to start answering back in Spanish.

So I searched the internet and other sources for the best learning apps and websites that I could find. My journey was a long a tedious one because some of the apps did not work or just did not help with the learning process as much. Then a friend told me about an app they were using which I might be interested in so I said okay what is the name of this new app and they said it's called duo lingo. So I downloaded it and finally I could speak spanish. It's no easy to learn spanish. It takes people years to learn. Also some people will never learn. Now is the time to learn as well. I dont think I would learn if not for duo. I had a very difficult time before. Some people think that apps dont work. Others go to school for years.

Can't believe I haven't written on this yet, but let me say, what an adventure that was. We went down to the Keys to celebrate a long year of hard work and take some time off together and finally get some quality time. We went down under the water the first day, after a few alcoholic beverages (of course). The fish were awesome, the life was so colorful, but no color more intense than the sunburn I had when we finished up! Oh boy, did I make a mistake forgetting to put on sunscreen that day. I came out like an infrared camera on a hot cherry cobbler -- I am talking molten red. I remember saying, ""well, I'm gonna pay for this hard later on tonight!"" By the night time, I decided that if I drank more iced beverages it might keep my mind off of the sunburn, and, surprisingly, that worked well for a while. Sleeping was hell on Earth, though, as I had to lay on ice packs borrowed from the resort desk to even close my eyes. Luckily, the burns subsided rather quickly, and simply glowed an awful red for a few days before turning into a nice tan. Thankfully for me, I've always had a good ability to recover quickly from sunburns. Perhaps that's why I always forget about sunscreen? Hmm, I don't know, but it wasn't fun. After that fiasco, we got to do much more of what we had planned, enjoying snorkeling and swimming and honestly just a lot of relaxing.

It was memorable because of how amazing the experience was being somewhere completely new doing an activity and viewing things in a new way that we hadn't experienced before. And we got to do it together. It barely cost us any money and we got to have a great experience. The most surprising part of the whole ordeal was that I wasn't scared to go out deep into the ocean. I felt healthy and good about myself and the fact that I accomplished something that for myself was a big feat even if other people might not see it as a big deal. I had been very nervous to do this. We viewed sea creatures such as a few fish, a giant crab, and other smaller little crabs. There wasn't very many fish which I was surprised about but the experience was still interesting. I saw the way the sea worked and all of its components that make it the ecosystem it is today. I also realized how hot the sun is down there because we both got very burnt on our backs from them being exposed to the sun for a few hours. The time went by faster than I can ever remember and it was my most memorable experience this year. We want to go back but have no idea when.

So my friends birthdays was definitely a highlight of the last month, I still have some good memories about it and I smile every time I do. This even showed me different sides of of and what I could be and in this sense it is significant and I would even say life changing.  Some of the other things that I remember is playing darts with people I never met before, we had fun and I felt connected just playing this simple game. I also remember meeting a cute girl, she a blond hair and her name was Anabel, I felt like I known her for ages for some reason, maybe it was the music that made me feel nostalgic but probably it was just a dejavu. The birthdays itself lasted for two days, since it stated on the weekend and my friend could afford an even longer holiday. There were a lot of fun thing to do and the food was amazing, my favorite dish was pizza of course, it was a real Italian pizza from some high end catering service. Also the fresh sashimi was great and tasty. The music was great and the DJ did a great job adjusting to our mood and taking guest requests into consideration. So this birthday was more of a concert than a typical home birthday I am used to and expected to experience.  There were some people whom I've know since I was a kid and it was a very pleasant meeting since we haven't seen each other for ages.  At midnight there was a fireworks show and not like a small fireworks that you can buy anywhere on Halloween but an actual commercial grade fireworks which were huge and loud like it was a major holiday or something, so I really enjoyed that part since you don't see that too often in a common weekend. Since it was a two day celebration and since my friend has a big house, most guests could just stay overnight in one of the bedrooms, it made us all feel even closer and the next morning I felt even more connected to the new people I have met the previous day as well as to my old childhood friends.  Overall it was one of the best birthday celebrations in my life and I really enjoyed it and will probably remember it for a long time if not till the rest of my life.  It was his 30th birthday and I guess that's why he decided to do on such a large scale and many of us felt grateful for that, especially since we knew what a good and kind person he was and this wasn't even necessary for us to start thinking of him even better.",1,I went to a friend's birthday party on my own where I would not know a large majority of the other guests.

He was inviting a lot of other friends, and he was making a sort of event about the whole thing, marking it as both his birthday as well as his funeral. There was going to nearly 50 people there, some I was already very friendly with and some new faces, as well as lots of food, lots of drinks, and lots of games. I was very much looking forward to the party but a little bit nervous about meeting so many new people at once, as I am somewhat shy. I went over in mind about maybe backing out, maybe only sticking with the few friends there I already knew very well, but eventually I settled on just sucking it up and going on my own. When I got there, I instantly felt somewhat out of place because I only knew a few faces, but that did not deter me from having my mind set on having a good time. I threw myself out there in some games, got talking to a lot of new people, and ended up making a lot of new friends throughout the night. As it went on, I felt less and less shy and nervous about trying to make a good impression. I began to be able to break out of my shell and act like myself, and I am so glad I did. The whole party was an absolute blast and I made a lot of friends, many of whom I will be contacting in the future with more plans to hang out. This party was a big step for me. It has been awhile since I have been able to put myself out there and try to meet new people. I was nervous about whether or not these new friends would be receptive to my personality or if I would come off as the weird awkward dude in the corner. My good friends who were there even commented on how they were impressed with how social I was being with total strangers. That might have been helped by the few beers I had, but that liquid courage got me past the first few hurdles I needed help with. I need to just be more confident in myself as a person, and the people around me will start to see me in a better light.",1,I went to a friend's birthday party on my own where I would not know a large majority of the other guests.

The falls were truly breathtaking, and the water was quite cold since it was still winter time when I went.  Once I had my fill of the Falls I also checked out the Chinese cuisines that Toronto had to offer, and I was not disappointed, the food was truly amazing.  The vegetables were fresh, and crisp, while the rice was truly perfect, not too hard, and not too soft, but a good balance of firmness.  I also decided to see the CN tower, and was truly mesmerized by the sheer size of that structure, especially since it was right there, in downtown Toronto.  The sunset was also breathtaking and beautiful, but I don't think that is a strong enough word for how magnificent the sunset truly was.  I loved the trip because I do love exploring and just getting out and doing something different, exploring places I've never been before, and seeing the sheer beauty and raw power of nature, like the Falls provide.  The Chinese food was quite exquisite, as was the CN tower.   I would definitely recommend a trip like this one to my friends because it was such a nice place to go and see.  I think seeing the Falls and the CN tower should be on anyone's bucket list because of just how surreal the tower was, and how serene the Falls were, with that power, and sound of all of the water rushing.  The drive was a little bit rough from Kentucky, since the traffic also isn't kind once I got to Cincinnati, and then from there it just seemed to pick up more when I got up to Toledo and into Detroit.  I think it took me about 14 hours to drive up, I didn't stay at a hotel or anything, although I did take some pit stops to get food, fuel, and other various supplies.  I think I liked seeing the CN tower most, just because of how staggering it looks, right there in downtown Toronto, and also it's proximity to the rest of the city made it a very convenient place to visit while being close to the hotel and restaurants.  The Falls were a little bit far from the city, but not bad.  In closing, I'd like to say that this trip opened my eyes to what North America has to offer in general, and also what our northern neighbors have to offer also in terms of natural and man-made beauty.",1,"We were on a road trip driving from Kentucky, all the way to the Niagara Falls and Toronto.

My wife and I are busy professionals, and we also have an 8 year old. Things have been going downhill, and luckily, we eventually recognized that if my wife and I did not take time to build connections in our relationship, things would just get worse. As a result, we decided to take a long road trip all the way to Canada (my home country). My wife and son like to travel to new places, and therefore, this seemed like the perfect choice. The trip didn't start off well, as my wife realized a day before the trip that her passport had expired. I was a little anxious about this, but we decided to go anyway. We'd figured she'd have alternative documentation to enter Canada, and at most we would be delayed at the border on our way back. We stopped by at Columbus for night before arriving at Niagara Falls on the US side the next day. We took a little time to experience that side of the Falls before reaching our hotel on the Canadian side. It was awesome. We had a bird-eyes view of the Falls, which were brightly and colorfully illuminated at night. The next day we spent all our time exploring as many activities as we could. We definitely enjoyed the up-close experience next to the Falls, and didn't mind getting soaking wet. The next day we drove to Toronto so that we could visit the CN tower, one of Canada's landmarks. There was a long line up, but the wait was well worth it. Our son definitely enjoyed watching the city from way high above. We ended our visit  with sampling of some of the finer chinese food, which of course we can't find in Kentucky. Driving back made me a little nervous because of my wife's expired passport. W ehanded it to the Border Patrol agent, who asked me a few questions, before stating that  my wife's passport was expired. We pleased ignorance and offered my wife's drivers license, which we knew was not considered an acceptable form of ID for re-entering. Delightfully, the agent said he didn't need anything else and just wanted to tell us of our expired passport so that we could fix it when we got home. What a nice way to end our trip. My wife and I definitely enjoyed taking the time off from work to reconnect.",2,"We were on a road trip driving from Kentucky, all the way to the Niagara Falls and Toronto.

The plan involved stops in Columbus as well as Niagara Falls, the main attraction of our trip. One day before our trip, my wife found out that her US passport had expired four months ago. Nevertheless, we decided to proceed with our trip and hope for the best. We stayed a night at Columbus, and took the opportunity to visit the Science Museum and also spend some time at TopGolf for a few shots. The next day we drove all the way to Niagara Falls on the US side. It was really fun, and our first time there. We took a tour around Hurricane Deck which put us right next to some falls, and we all enjoyed getting wet. It was especially memorable for me, because I had not felt this much joy and togetherness, due to recent marital problems I had been experiencing.

The closest I can identify with it is just the element of visiting Florida. I went to Disney World when I was a kid, and I vividly remember how amazing the tropical atmosphere was.","All of my years in college have finally been paying off for me, and I feel like I am on course to have a fulfilling career. Throughout all of the hard work and effort, I knew that there would come a time when I would finally be able to have some sort of payoff and be able to enjoy the fruits of my labors, if indirectly. I have always enjoyed spring break and have had a great time, when I could actually take my mind of of coursework and appreciate it for what it was. However, nothing compares to the fantastic concert I attended two months ago, after classes had wrapped up. Me and several of my friends pooled our money together to make it to a music festival that was taking place on a Caribbean island, not far off the coast of Florida. It was simply an incredible time, one of the best memories of my entire life. The quality of the light when you are closer to the equator is just sublime, and the thing that sticks in my mind more than anything else is the sight of the sunrise and sunset during those few days we were there. It felt like stepping into a new world, and I had actually never been anywhere like that even on vacation with my family as a kid. The actual music festival was of course very special, but most of our time was spent on other things. We stayed at a rented place that we pooled our money together for, and it was not all that expensive since there were a few of us in each room. The fishing trip we went on on the second day of our visit was probably the most activity I got the entire time. I didn't feel like working up much of a sweat when I was already soaked in it just the moment I stepped out the front door of our accommodations. The climax of the music festival was something that made me feel like I had goosebumps. One of my favorite electronic musicians was performing and the view of the sunset over the beach as the music built up was just otherworldly. It was not something that I would soon forget, and I think that there will probably be few chances to ever have an experience like this again in the future. One thing I can say is that I met a couple who were very interesting, and we exchanged contact details. So there is a significant chance we may do something together in the future, which is exciting. It is very cool just to talk to random new people you run into in an unfamiliar place.",3,"Island Jam with many bands and many friends and sun and fun.

They had me doing my original job, plus a second job, for the salary of just one job.  The second job represented the next step toward my career goals and a realization of a lot of the time and resources I've put toward advancing my career.  However, the salary was not commensurate with the amount of work I was doing, I was putting in nearly 90 hours a week, and the situation was incredibly stressful.  It started to take a toll on my physical and emotional health and strained my relationships with family, friends, and coworkers.  The dual-role situation was expected to last one year, at which point my second job would be split off into its own role, which I would fill.  However, an the organization faced some unexpected financial hardship, which meant they had to reduce positions, rather than create new one.  This meant they asked me to continue in the dual role for another year, promising to split the roles in another year's time, when finances were better.  After a long and careful consideration, I determined to decline and take a position with another organization which would be a lateral move.  I applied for and was offered the new job, which I accepted.  After already initiating the onboard process with the new organization, my old organization called and begged me to come back.  They offered a slightly different arrangement of my role.  However, it would still require significant time (and likely stress) for the same amount of pay and no guarantee of the company's future stability.  It put me back in the throes of decision making.  Ultimately, I turned them down again but I did have some feelings of melancholy.  Fortunately, the latest update of this story takes a turn for the happy.  I have been recruited by a third organization to fulfill a newly created role in my desired field.  I've had a hand in defining the role, bargaining for my pay, and shaping the next steps of my career.

This was one of the hardest choices I have had to make; but, for the first time ever, I put myself and family ahead of my career and made the switch.  Then, a few weeks ago, the assistant superintendent of my former district called me and said they had found a way to offer me the career and technical education administration position without special education responsibilities, which is what I had originally been looking for.  However, I would have to also be the district's data and assessment coordinator and my salary would still be the same.  The chance to continue down the path of my career aspirations was so incredibly tantalizing.  On the other hand, the school year is about to start and I really like my new district a lot, the community is supportive, benefits are excellent, and I feel good about my future there.  The difficulty of the decision felt suffocating.  I actually threw up I was so anxious about it.  But, in the end, I decided to stick with my choice to take care of myself and told my old district that I could not come back.  I have thought about it a lot the last few weeks, and I am still glad I made that decision.  With students coming back to school in a week, we will quickly find out if I am still happy with my choice!",5,I was in a tough job that advanced my career but hurt my health.

And had some misgivings about the new people, you know because it meant another black family leaving the neighborhood and another rich yuppie couple coming to further gentrify.

Consequently, I always hold my breath when someone's moving out until I know who's going to live there next, always hoping for the best.  This new neighbor moved in as fast as my old neighbors moved out.  I heard her over there the first day she was there and I walked over to introduce myself to her.  She's ten years older than I am, single, and very pleasant.  As it turns out, surprisingly, we know a lot of the same people and have a lot of interests in common.  Our values seem to be the same, and both of us want to be good neighbors, which is a relief to both of us.  (She was concerned about what type of person I was, too.)  My new neighbor and I quickly started becoming friends.  When we see each other outside, we always take a few minutes to exchange pleasantries and talk.  She has trouble doing some things because she has a bad back, so I've been helping her out whenever I can.  She's so grateful for that, she's gone out of her way to do some things for me.  She loves to cook and she's shared meals with me.  She has little dinner parties every other week or so and I'm always invited.  I've really enjoyed getting to know my new neighbor.  I always enjoy seeing her and I know she's there for me.  If I have to go away, I know she'll keep an eye on the place for me, and likewise, I'd do the same for her.

I've had some great neighbors there for the past 7 months, but they told me when I met them that that was only going to be a temporary place for them.  They were new to the area and just needed a place to live until they could find a home to buy.  They spent a long time looking for a place to call their own and eventually found it in a nearby town.  Even though I know I'll still see them from time to time, it was hard to see them go. After my old neighbors moved out, I wondered who'd move into the house next door.  I didn't have to wait long to find out.  Almost as soon as my old neighbors moved out, a new neighbor moved in, and I went over and introduced myself to her.  She was happy to meet me.  It turns out, we have a lot of things in common and even know some of the same people.  I was relieved because you never know who might move into a rental.  Better yet, this woman plans on staying there until she dies (her words, not mine), so there shouldn't be people coming and going there anymore for some time to come.  My new neighbor is elderly and needed some help moving things into her new home, so I whelped her.  Afterwards, I took some brownies over so she could enjoy a little chocolate after dinner.  She was so happy about that, she went on and on about it.  Then, a few days later, she called me over to her place and told me that she had something she wanted to give me.  It was something I needed for my kitchen which I hadn't been able to find in the stores.  I vaguely remembered mentioning something about it to her, but I was surprised she paid any attention to it and then did something about it.  She saw exactly what I was looking for at a yard sale and purchased it for me.  I offered to reimburse her for it, but she wouldn't let me give her a penny.  She said she was just so thankful to have a good neighbor who was so helpful that she wanted to give it to me as a thank you.  I was deeply touched.

I jumped at the offer, naturally, and he said he'd have his secretary bring the papers over shortly. I was trying not to act like a fool so I very humbly thanked him and told him I wouldn't let him down. Once the phone hit the receiver though I confess I danced a little jig. This was going to be a BIG promotion with a lot more pay/benefits, as well as responsibility. The papers to sign arrived and I quickly signed. After the secretary left I rang up my wife and told her to find her nicest dress, we were going out to celebrate tonight. When she asked what for, I sprung the good news on her and I had to move the phone away from my head as she squealed in delight. We'd been scrimping and saving for awhile now, and had been hoping to take a nice vacation. After telling her goodbye I leaned back in the chair and imagined what my new office would look like. I could almost smell the fine furniture and feel the aged oak desk beneath my fingers. Maybe I'd even have a nice little plaque with my name emblazoned on it?

Then he tells me, what do you think if I offer you a supervisory position of the department? I was in shock and my answer was of course yes, this is the opportunity that I was looking for since I start in this company, all the hard work finally pay off. Then he makes me sign a paper with my salary increase and the new title.

I still go to call her on the phone at least 3 times a week. I wish my own adult children called me. They think texting is the same as speaking. In my opinion it can't replace hearing the sound of a loved ones voice-the inflection, the expression. Christmas was terrible. Just my husband and me.. Our cairn terrier died recently. New Year's Eve was even worse. My godchild who is a medical fellow who lives about 2 hours from here begged me to come to her house  because her husband, also a fellow, accused her of something she didn't do -so absolutely outrageous and left. So she paid for me to come by Uber. Happy New Year. Her parents were born in India and they don't believe that she wants a divorce and keep telling her what a good guy he is. At one time I thought so too, but now  I think he's a major control freak. . I know their marriage has made her unhappy and know more about this than her parents  do, but the Indian culture is so different She was raised here.. She needs to be her own person.  My mother was very close to her and her husband of 4 years because they were medical residents where my family lives. She counseled both of them many times....also fed them:-) Wherever her spirit is I know she's flipping out about this. Of course he returned to the house after I left the next evening but notg to speak to her or to try to fix this broken marriage, but to mentally abuse her.

FOUR MONTHS.  I mean, it started so badly, you know? Internet dating is one thing, but ""finding random person on Craigslist"" sounds like the beginning of one of those murder/investigation shows on television, but no. She was a real person who just wanted someone to go to a concert with her so she wouldn't have to go alone. Emily's cool, though, so no ""my wife is an axe murderer"" here.  Not that I probably wouldn't deserve it, but I won't complain.  I mean, I ruined the concert and she's already forgiven met--it's not like I could have predicted the stomach flu, but I probably could have managed not to puke on her shoes--and she was awesome about things when the tire went flat.  She was like Superwoman, swinging the tire iron around like she knew exactly what to do with it (even though she told me she'd never changed a tire before.) I don't think I could have written a worst first date.  Maybe accidental broken bones or a trip to the ER, but puke and flat tires run a close second. Thinking too much about that feels like tempting Fate, though. It's probably silly, but I found tickets to see that band she likes so much again.

I was heading to the movies with a friend who had been begging me to go see it for days, although now I can't even fully recall which it was. There wasn't a lot of time for me to think as I was still groggy, so I quickly went back inside to grab a cup of coffee before heading out. Turning on the machine and hearing it whirr to start up I decided that I would also flick on the television real fast just to see what was going on in the world. I honestly can't remember what I saw, as my mind is blurry from the entire thing but I do remember it being quite boring to the point of remarkability, but what did stick out was the traffic alert. We were going to be late to the movie if we didn't leave soon so I quickly grabbed whatever coffee had been finished and rushed out the door having a completely black cup of joe that I didn't even want anymore. My friend was waiting for me at her house when I picked her up and was a bit annoyed that I was late, but I didn't think much of it. Now this is the part that really, really stuck out to me. Right as she got into the car, her daughter quickly ran outside and called her back in. When she came back out she was bright red and told me that she couldn't go, that she had to stay home and didn't want to explain but I was adamant and so she did. Apparently the babysitter couldn't make it in time and so it was all a bust, but instead of letting her feel bad I drove home real quick and picked up a blu-ray of a movie that I figured she would enjoy and drove back to her house. At this point you can probably realize this isn't exactly just a friend, but someone who I had wanted to impress and so when I returned and showed her the blu-ray we watched it together and it was a pretty awesome experience. The entire time all I could think was about how lucky I was to be in this house with her and her family, who seemed to be pretty receptive of me. Anyways, once this was all over instead of leaving she offered for me to stay for dinner and this is the first time I would ever have a meal with her alone as her daughter took a nap right after eating a few minutes earlier. This is so memorable for me because it was the first experience that I had in a romantic setting with this woman who I am now currently dating and I'll never forget it.",3,"I was going to go on a date with a woman but things didn't go as planned.

It was a great way to get away from the family, and I was very thrilled to be doing so. I brought my larger tent, as I felt the 2-man tent was not going to cut it. I had to find a clearing in the woods so that I could place it, and there was a nice spot about 300 feet in from the road. However, it was overshadowed by a 25 foot dead pine tree that was in the process of falling over. I pulled out my axe and helped it, knocking it down in about 10 minutes of work. I had to use my saw in certain parts due to the way the tree was angled. Once I finally got it down, I had plenty of firewood at my disposal, right next to my camp! I proceeded to de-limb the tree for kindling, and then sawed the larger main trunk of the tree for actual firewood. After clearing the area for about an hour, I now had a nice flat place to put my tent. I pitched my tent after sweeping the area with a few branches. When that was done, I decided to scour the area for large stones so that I could build a fire pit. I found about a dozen decent sized stones and carried them back to the campsite. I dug a small pit and arranged the stones around it, a wonderful start to my camping trip. From that point on, it was basically cooking, enjoying the scenery, and being along with my thoughts. I did some scouting around the area and found a very old graveyard, which I estimated to be at least 140 years old! The strange thing is that it was on top of a mountain, so someone had to come up here to build it. I feel it was an appropriate place, as the area was quite beautiful and had a wonderful view. I really enjoyed my camping trip up in the woods and got some much needed relaxation and time to myself, without the chattering of my wife and children to distract me. I plan on doing this again and cannot wait until my next trip.",1,"I went camping up in the woods by myself. Felling a tree, cooking my own food, and being one with nature.

However, after spending years studying together, we gradually got close. As I stood next to her, I was overwhelmed with feelings. I witnessed her with every guy she dated, for countless time I comforted her while she cried over a heartbreak. However, today, someone deserves her finally came and took her hand. I remembered back when they first started dating, out of my protecting instinct, I was skeptical about the new guy. I was worried he would break her heart again just like her exes. Over the time, he proved himself that not only he deserves her, but also he's the best one you can think of as her husband. I looked at my best friend getting married to her love when unexpectedly, a baby cried out loud right after she said ""I do"" to her husband. Everyone almost laughed out loud due to the coincidence. Obviously, the a crying kid is never pleasant but because of the oddly right timing, it had become one of the most memorable events at the wedding.

He worked at an electronic shop as a sales representative so he did not make enough money yet he spends much more than he earns. It was that bad that i sometimes began to imagine how Jennifer managed to put up with all of his excesses .The most devastating problem about Nathan was that he was a chronic womanizer. In the course of there relationship he has cheated on Jennifer more than seven times, the ones i can still remember or would i say the ones he was caught and could not deny them. Jennifer was sometimes traumatized and always caught in an emotional blackmail. She suffered a lot during the six years of there relationship. I could not understand why she keeps condoling his act of cheating on her. So one day she cried and came to me to complain about how Nathan has just cheated on her i was so mad at her, Nathan and her entire relationship that i screamed at her attempting to give a  piece of my mind. I asked her what she was doing with that good for nothing man, she told me she loved him so much and that she has tried to stop loving him but cannot. the more she tries the more the love increases and how she can not live without him . In frustration i told her to leave my house and that i did not want to hear about Nathan and her relationship with him ever again. both after two years their relationship was still on. Nathan had apologized to her and she forgave him as always and there were back together. Nathan got some religion into his life, he is now a christian. Jennifer told me how everything about Nathan has tremendously changed. I saw the joy i hadn't seen in her for a long time i was happy for her.

This isn't like Kate, but I know she just broke up with her boyfriend and has been argumentative with most of us so I've basically written it off as a one-shot problem with her. In the last six months, she's finally been her normal self with everyone including me. Anyway, a couple of my teammates and I were at a party and a video of that particular game was being played and I watched that fight again. I'm very frustrated at myself. I had them run the video several times at a very slow rate and I finally saw what Kate had originally told me. It was Ann who started the fight very subtly and unnoticeable but definitely showed running the video slowly. The referee, Ohio State's captain and I were all wrong and Ann, the player had lied. I feel like a poor captain but mostly, my not trusting Kate has really gotten me down. I took her aside and apologized over and over about it. She's forgiven me but hoped that I would never distrust her again.",4,It was 6 months ago happen in my college team. It was an incident happen and removed the wrong person from the team.

It seemed like we were stuck in a rut. Then, we both remembered an online friend we had met via social media. Although we had never met in person before, we decided to meet up with them after this budding online relationship. My wife suggested that we go downtown for dinner and drinks. I messaged the person, and they said they'd love to join. Actually, it seemed like they were too enthusiastic about the meetup. This led to some high anxiety on my part, since I tend to be skeptical. I asked myself questions like ""Is this invitation socially acceptable?"" and ""Why is this person so eager to meet us?"". Luckily, my wife was able to talk out the doubt and reduce my apprehension toward the situation. So, we got ready, my wife being a little late as usual, and took a taxi downtown to meet our new friend. As we arrived to the restaurant, our new friend and us both got out of the taxis at the same time, so we had a good laugh. From then on, the night seemed to go rather smoothly. We talked about our lives and our interests, and there seemed to be a real friendship budding. After a few drinks, we decided to call it a night and exchanged more contact information. We decided that we'll see each other in a few weeks. Overall, it was great. I'm so glad my wife calmed me down.

We don't have a ton of money to spend on vacation, so any little trip is a big deal for us. Also we totally suck at planning things, and hadn't done anything all summer, until we really buckled down and started making a cohesive plan. We splurged and got a hotel near the park for two nights, and invited a friend of ours from Tennessee to come stay with us too. His name was Nick, and we'd never met him.	That is to say, we met him on Twitch. Karl and I started streaming a little over a year ago, and while I got bored of it fairly quickly, he kept at it and ended up starting a small group of streamers. Nick was one of the first members added to the group, all of us fans of the game Dropmix (a strange music/card game hybrid). In the months that followed we would all become closer watching each others stream at different times of the day, keeping each other company at work and so on. So when we invited him to stay with us, we felt like we knew him.	I would describe myself as having a high degree of social anxiety. I had some hesitation about meeting someone in real life who only knew me from my online persona.	But it ended up being awesome! Karl, Nick, and myself all share a love of roller coasters in addition to weird card games, and surprisingly none of us had ever been to Kentucky Kingdom before. The lines were short and they offered free soda to visitors from out of town (I won't say no!), the rides were awesome, and the people-watching was on point. The only drawback to the whole thing was that Nick and Karl both snore. But I'd had enough to drink each night that it wasn't much of an issue. I ended up feeling glad that we rallied and planned a trip, however quaint. It's something more people should try. Even just a few days away with friends made the stressful reality of day to day life a little more tolerable.",1,"My partner and I, despite being lazy, planned a trip with a friend we'd only met online.

Through talking with the admission officers and touring students, we captured a lot of information about admission policy, documents need to be prepared, majors, and student campus life. It was very helpful for my child to select ones they are interested in and would pursue their studies in the future. It is is very important to touch these necessary information early prior to their application deadlines. We drove to a few cities nearby where the universities we are interested in located. We visited 2 schools each day during this trip. We first visited a few schools on the east coast, then visited others on the southwest side. A few Ivy leagues schools were included into this trip. According to the well known rule, we divided these schools into three categories, reach, match, and safe to schedule our visit concentrations. For a reach school, we focused on to learn more about the admission policy. For a match or safe school, we concentrated on the required documents including SAT test scores. During the visit, we figured out which major could be more promising one when applying for a reach school, considering as a premed track student later on. For a match or safe school, we strictly followed up the most interested major such as Biomedical engineering in one engineering school. We compared the similar ranks of schools in terms of student population size, campus life, major strength, faculty to student ratio etc. We finally narrowed down to 10 schools in our list. One of things need to mentioned especially here: be sure to check in on time prior to your information session. For example, WashU treated a campus visiting as the demonstrated interesting of a student on them. Some of schools followed up us after our campus visiting. It is also useful for a family to on-site check the student residence and meal plan in one specific school.

My kids are ready going to their college in next a few year. We scheduled for 9 university information sessions and the corresponding campus tours during this trip. We have greatly enjoyed this impressive and informative trip. We directly contacted with the teachers and students from these universities and learned a lot of new information about our interested university. This was a very important visit for my kids to prepare their university applications later on. As their parents, we also felt this visit was very helpful for us to prepare for the coming important events. We learned how to start the preparations for the promising universities earlier. My son has been aiming on his dream school, MIT, because his friends went to this school. I helped him to sort the candidate majors out and went through the admission pages carefully. After talked with the teachers and students there, my son recognized what were his strengths and weaknesses. He said he would start preparations of his standardized tests more earlier. He have made a detail plan for the next 3 years for this endeavor. I thought that it would be better for a family to arrange this kind of campus visit more earlier, i.e. 3 years prior to the university application. This kind of activities obviously encouraged my kids to be more active on their studies. As parents, we also could help them in more specific manors instead of non-focused ways. Through these visits, my kids had their direct experiences with the university campus life. We learned more detail about their interested majors in the candidate universities instead of just numbers such as accept rate and university ranking. We would narrow down the school list and re-visit some of them in the future.

I am pretty much open to any type of music anyway, but rock is easily near the top of my list of genres. I really started getting excited when I found out the band involved was one of my favorite rock bands from the 80's. Aside from the water part, I was a fairly easy sell. Within minutes of getting on the ship we all realized how unbelievable this experience would be. In addition to nightly performances from the band, the whole band mingled with everyone just like regular people throughout the entire trip. I remember walking into the bathroom and having to wait for the lead singer to finish before I could use the toilet.

All of my friends had a blast on the cruise too, and I barely even noticed the fact that we were so far out on the water. The last night ended up being a massive blowout concert that seemed to go on for hours. The atmosphere was so perfect that I'm not sure it's possible to ever forget how great the experience was. To think I might have skipped out on this trip due to my fear of water is almost crazy now.

I go to many concerts and it is one of my favorite things to do so I knew I could really enjoy this experience. From seeing band members at the airport when I landed to being in the same boarding group I was excited for the week. There were bands on the cruise who I had been a fan of for years and they were all very accessible and laid back that you could sit and chat with them just like they are a regular person. There was one band in particular who I enjoyed and I was really looking forward to and they were only doing one performance on the cruise the first night. It was in a small lobby area with open balconies looking down, the area was packed full and the performance seemed so intimate and special that I still get goosebumps thinking about it. The singer commented that they were just guys who like sitting around a fire with an acoustic guitar and singing so they were going to do a sing-along, he and one of the guitarists sat on the bar and sang a cover and had everyone watching join in. All the concerts I go to and this was by far one that I will never forget. One other really unique part of this cruise is that they not only have complete bands but they also have individual musicians who do an all star jam type performance of famous covers. Before going I was told to not miss those performances and I made sure to watch each time they had one and was not disappointed at all. I have talked with bands since the cruise when they came to my city on tour and they all talk fondly about what a great time they had so it's really cool that both bands and attendees all have great experiences. The other thing that I really enjoyed is that anywhere you went during the cruise; the dining room or off the boat at ports, you would run into band members who were just having a great time and enjoying their vacation as well. There were no egos at all. We have booked to go back on the cruise next year and I'm getting excited because it's getting closer. I feel like I almost planned too much for this past year and now I know that it's ok to just go with the flow and relax.",3,I went on a rock cruise with some friends.

One of my friends had posted a youtube video from last year's and another friend commented that she really wanted to go on it sometime so I replied that if she was serious we should plan it because I really wanted to as well. The two of us, the original friend who posted it and another friend of theirs were able to get a quad cabin and go. I wasn't sure what to expect and was a little nervous about what to pack or what the experience would be like. I have gone to lots of concerts for year and I always am happy and comfortable at rock concerts. From the time we got on the boat I felt at home and like I was meant to be there. The first night of the cruise one of the bands I was most interested in seeing was doing a performance in a pretty small lobby area so I made sure to get there early so I could get a spot; I was able to get a spot on the stairs looking down on the stage and the performance was nothing less than chill inducing. You could feel the passion in their performance and everyone watching was locked in enjoying it. At one point the singer said that they were just a bunch of Texas boys used to sitting around a campfire with an acoustic guitar and beers and singing, he and one of the guitarists went and sat on the bar and did what turned into a singalong of a classic rock song. Everyone in that lobby area all the way up to the balconies looking down was signing along. I felt at home and actually teared up at what a special moment it was. Throughout the cruise we would run into band members all over the place; in the dining hall, at the ports, in the casino, just hanging out and they were all nice as could be.  I left my phone in my cabin most of the time and wasn't even concerned with taking photos or videos of performances, I just lived in the moment. I stood and talked with band members of bands who I have been a fan of for years and they seemed to have a genuine interest in what we were talking about, I got to meet people I never would have dreamed of meeting and I discovered some new bands. Since the cruise ended I bought a meet and greet for one of the bands when they were in my town and I mentioned that we ""vacationed together"" and all of them lit up talking about the experience. One of the members of the band had been sitting behind me with his girlfriend at a comedy show and I offered to buy them drinks, just because I'm a fan and appreciate what their music has gotten me through and done for me. With no prompting, he looked at me and said, ""Wait. I remember you, you bought me a beer! My girlfriend and I really appreciated that!"" and we had more of a conversation about the cruise. I figured I would have a good time and I always wanted to go on this cruise because it is very popular in the rock community. I had an even better time than I imagined I would.

Even though safety issues began to happen more and more, our supervisor simply kept piling on more work. Her boss told her it wasn't important and we could skip doing it, but my supervisor wanted to impress everyone and be ""number 1"" so she ignored all advice. Whispers began behind her back, the other pharmacists began to worry about their licenses but the pressure just kept mounting. I found the wrong pills in a bottle on the shelf and my supervisor got mad at me, even though I had not filled from that bottle at all that week. Nothing was ever mentioned again and I began to lie awake at 3 in the morning wondering if the wrong medication had gone out unnoticed before or since. This income was so important to my family, the job was so important to my self-worth but I knew if anything happened I would be liable no matter who was truly at fault. My job had been toxic to begin with, my supervisor was abusive and infamous in our company for being a nasty person. My coworkers trained me by yelling at me and then arguing and ranting with each other in Spanish about me. But I persisted, I did not want to let them win. Every morning I hoped I would get in a car wreck serious enough that I could not work for the foreseeable future. I snapped at my husband, I snapped at my child. Every moment not spent at work was filled with crushing dread that I would have to go back in a few hours. My marriage suffered greatly, my self-esteem was trashed. Yet still I kept on. But that one little tablet of Tramadol was enough to snap me out of it. I was terrified, someone with over a decade of experience had mistakenly put a controlled substance into a bottle of blood pressure medication. And no one caught it. The counts of the controlled medication done every day weren't off? That seemed odd to me, every tablet of those is so tightly accounted for that someone either counted wrong or they noticed but didn't have time to deal with the paperwork so they brushed it aside. How many times had it happened before? Why was I being blamed? These questions ate at me and ate at me until I realized I was killing myself for a job that would throw me under the bus even knowing criminal charges could be brought against me when I didn't do anything wrong.

I was on the phone, helping a patient, and also filling prescriptions as fast as I could. The pharmacist in charge (PIC) was picking her nose while telling me to go faster, faster, faster. I felt so angry that she wouldn't even pick up the phone and put someone on hold while us techs were working at such dangerous paces. And then it happened. A customer asked me to count their pills again so they knew they were receiving the right amount. I understood why, we were visibly overworked and understaffed, but was also very irritated at having yet another task added to my plate. I grabbed the vial, dumped it out, and then my blood ran cold. The PIC stopped digging in her nose and looked down at the same time I did--she lead by micromanaging us right down to how many times a day we urinated, and she started whisper yelling at me. There was a very dangerous drug mixed in with the blood pressure pills. How it happened, who initially put the wrong drug in the wrong bottle, who verified it at the final check, it didn't matter. This was not a failure of the multi-step process or the team in her eyes. No, the fault was mine and mine alone. My bladder was strained, my feet hurt, and I could not safely multitask another day. I went home and thought about it, obsessed over it, dreamed about it. I showed up for work the next day and worried over every patient. I worried that the other techs were not able to work safely either, that the other pharmacists were so worried about whether patients were coming in for vaccinations to meet a goal that I was actually going to kill someone next time. I worried that someone was sitting down to take the wrong medicine right that moment and there was nothing I could do.  The next day was my day off and I felt dread, crippling dread. And then I woke up at 3 in the morning and realized I didn't have to go in the next day. I didn't have to go back ever again. So without warning, without thought I quit. Just like that.

Often my mail is consumed with junk and most of it gets tossed into the recycling, but on this particualr day, there was a golden letter that I couldn't have been happier about receiving.  It was a letter informing me that the school was re-opening its doors.  This meant I my days of homeschooling were coming to an end!  A year earlier, I had learned that the school my children were going to was closing.  Major repairs needed to be done on the school and I had to find an alternative for my children.  I looked and looked for good alternatives, but there were none.  I live in a small town and the closest school was miles away.  It just wasn't feasable to drive my kids to school when it would take us an hour to get there and an hour to get back.  Hence, my journing into the world of homeschooling began.  I didn't want to homeschool because I knew it would be difficult.  My children were used to the routine of public school and not their mom being their teacher.  How was I supposed to keep them engaged and interested in learning when they are at home?  The distractions in the house were too great with all their electronic devices.  I decided that I had to become two different people, mom and teacher.  I also had to designate an area of the house as the school zone.  Despite this, my children had a hard time adjusting to me being their teacher.  They would wine about the homework and compare me to what it was like when they were attending public school.  I had to remind them over and over why we were doing things they way we were.  I think it took us a good couple of months to really get into the flow of homeschooling.  It wore me out to homeschool.  I did enjoy having my children home, but it was exhasting mentally and physically.  I was used to some quiet time during the day, but now my day was full of teaching my own children.  So on that blessed day close to two months ago when I recieved that letter informing me that the school was going to re-open, I jumped for joy.

So before I even had kids, the thought was playing in my mind, ""What if we can't afford private education and I HAVE TO homeschool?"" And sure enough, it did happen. After 3 good years of having my kids at that nice little school, it closed. I signed up with a homeschooling site and purchased materials. I studied them, prepared for the school year, and for the whole year, I persevered, doing it the best I could. I am sorry to say I did hate it.
