Topics in AI - Learning in Human's Final Project. 

A Python + machine learning model to predict whether a given context is recalled or imagined. This is an implementation of the https://maartensap.com/pdfs/sap2022quantifying.pdf
The project contains 2 phase 
Phase 1 : 
  Calculating the narrative flow(sequentiality) of the given context by using the Hippocorpus dataset. The dataset is used to derive Textual probablities and contextual probablities up to history size of 5. 

Phase 2: 
  As the result of Phase 1, data is preprocessed and a classification model is derived to classify recalled vs imagined events.
